        "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a headache and nausea. He reports that he was rocking his grandson to sleep when the symptoms began. He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing.

On physical exam, the patient has upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and a single transverse palmar crease. His abdomen is non-tender, firm, and distended. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Digital rectal exam evacuates a small amount of stool and flatulence. A nasogastric tube is placed to decompress the stomach. The patient\u2019s abdominal radiograph can be seen in Figure A.

He has a history of hypertension, major depressive disorder, Raynaud disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on 2 liters of oxygen at home. Current medications include lisinopril, inhaled umeclidinium-vilanterol, and as-needed albuterol. He drinks 4 beers a day and has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years. His temperature is 98.9\u00b0 F (37.2\u00b0 C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical exam is notable for an irregular pulse and scattered end-expiratory wheezes. An echocardiogram performed 1 month ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%.

The only other concern that the patient's mother has is that, upon awakening, she notices that sometimes the patient's arm will jerk back and forth. The patient states she is not doing this intentionally. The patient has an unknown medical history and is currently not on any medications. She is not sexually active and does not intend to become pregnant in the near future. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/74 mmHg, pulse is 63/min, and respirations are 11/min.
