        "question": "A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes.

Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study? Options: (A) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods. (B) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
