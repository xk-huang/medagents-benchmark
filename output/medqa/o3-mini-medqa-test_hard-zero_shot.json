She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nK+: 4.1 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL\nGlucose: 73 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.7 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mEq/L\nAST: 11 U/L\nALT: 11 U/L\nFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)\nEstrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries.

A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain.

Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm).

        "question": "A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because he is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. He first noticed the problem 8 months ago, when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He states that his relationship with his girlfriend is good, but his inability to engage in sexual intercourse has been frustrating. He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately. He had not been sexually active for the previous 3 years, since the death of his wife. He does not smoke. He drinks 4\u20136 beers on weekends. Current medications include simvastatin and citalopram. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate.
