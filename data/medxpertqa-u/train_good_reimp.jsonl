{"realidx": "Text-2452", "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. There was no trauma during the seizure. The patient’s medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. His current medications are hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metformin, and aspirin. According to his family, he smokes a pack of cigarettes and consumes 6 to 8 beers daily but does not use recreational drugs. His last alcohol consumption occurred approximately 36 hours before presentation.\n\n\nHis blood pressure is 160/110 mm Hg, his heart rate is 98 beats per minute and regular, and his respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. He is afebrile but confused and diaphoretic.\n\n\nA complete blood count shows mild macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. A biochemical profile shows a normal glucose level, mild hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, normal kidney function, and an elevated aspartate aminotransferase level.\n\n\nChest radiography is unremarkable. Noncontrast CT of the brain shows mild volume loss. Blood and urine drug test results are negative. An electrocardiogram is notable for sinus tachycardia and motion artifact.\n\n\nThiamine, multivitamins, folate, and electrolyte repletion are administered.

{"realidx": "Text-2450", "question": "A 60-year-old-female with hypertension and diabetes is in the emergency department complaining of 3 days of worsening back pain. The pain is located at the site of a surgery 2 weeks ago for a herniated disc. She has also been experiencing one day of fevers, chills, and fatigue. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate 96/min, respiratory rate 18/min, blood pressure 152/92 mm Hg. On her physical exam, the patient is alert and oriented, but appears acutely ill and is unable to lie supine due to discomfort. Her lungs are clear to auscultation in all fields, her heart rate is tachycardic with no audible murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Pulling aside her hospital gown, you see an area of erythema over the midline of her spine at the level L3/L4 at the site of her recent surgery that is exquisitely tender to gentle palpation. You place orders for this patient to include blood work of a CBC, blood cultures, CMP, ESR and CRP, imaging for a CT scan and MRI, request IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and call the spinal surgeon who performed her previous surgery as a consult. As you wait for each of these components of her work up to be undertaken, you consider what osteopathic techniques you have learned that might help your patient in this situation, and what might be appropriate given her possible diagnosis. Which of the following is true regarding the relevant indications or contraindications for such a case?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Indirect techniques to increase lymphatic drainage would be contraindicated in this patient who presents with an acute fever and whose workup is not complete (B) Due to its gentle and rhythmic application, direct articulation of the involved joint would be indicated as it would provide the most beneficial response (C) The presence of a red reflex visible over her lumbar region is an indication that HVLA should be directed towards that area (D) Articulatory treatment to the lumbar spine would be contraindicated due to the possibility of an acutely inflamed lumbar joint space (E) Any patient experiencing a fever in the post-operative period like this patient indicates that rib raising should be performed due to the high likelihood of atelectasis or pneumonia (F) Counterstrain techniques targeting the lumbar region would be indicated to alleviate the acute inflammatory response (G) Myofascial release techniques are contraindicated in the presence of post-operative fever and erythema over the surgical site (H) Lymphatic pump techniques should be prioritized to address systemic inflammation and fever (I) HVLA is contraindicated in this patient due to the possibility of underlying infection or abscess formation (J) Facilitated positional release targeting the lumbar spine is the optimal choice for managing acute post-operative inflammation", "options": {"A": "Indirect techniques to increase lymphatic drainage would be contraindicated in this patient who presents with an acute fever and whose workup is not complete", "B": "Due to its gentle and rhythmic application, direct articulation of the involved joint would be indicated as it would provide the most beneficial response", "C": "The presence of a red reflex visible over her lumbar region is an indication that HVLA should be directed towards that area", "D": "Articulatory treatment to the lumbar spine would be contraindicated due to the possibility of an acutely inflamed lumbar joint space", "E": "Any patient experiencing a fever in the post-operative period like this patient indicates that rib raising should be performed due to the high likelihood of atelectasis or pneumonia", "F": "Counterstrain techniques targeting the lumbar region would be indicated to alleviate the acute inflammatory response", "G": "Myofascial release techniques are contraindicated in the presence of post-operative fever and erythema over the surgical site", "H": "Lymphatic pump techniques should be prioritized to address systemic inflammation and fever", "I": "HVLA is contraindicated in this patient due to the possibility of underlying infection or abscess formation", "J": "Facilitated positional release targeting the lumbar spine is the optimal choice for managing acute post-operative inflammation"}, "answer_idx": "D", "answer": "Articulatory treatment to the lumbar spine would be contraindicated due to the possibility of an acutely inflamed lumbar joint space", "cleanse_cot": "### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, symptoms, physical exam findings, and vital signs.
