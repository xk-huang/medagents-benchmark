{"realidx": 1232, "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?", "answer": "A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.", "options": {"A": "A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.", "B": "A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.", "C": "A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.", "D": "A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study."}, "meta_info": "step2&3", "answer_idx": "A", "metamap_phrases": ["Background", "patients", "severe asthma", "frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic", "continuous treatment", "high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids", "oral glucocorticoids", "Methods", "randomized", "double-blind clinical trial", "assigned", "patients", "recurrent asthma exacerbations", "evidence", "eosinophilic inflammation", "high doses", "inhaled glucocorticoids", "one", "three study groups", "Patients", "assigned to receive mepolizumab", "humanized monoclonal antibody", "interleukin-5", "administered", "75 mg intravenous dose", "100 mg subcutaneous dose", "placebo", "4 weeks", "primary outcome", "rate", "exacerbations", "outcomes included", "forced expiratory volume in 1 second", "scores", "St", "Respiratory Questionnaire", "5 item Asthma Control Questionnaire", "Results", "rate", "exacerbations", "reduced", "95", "confidence interval", "29", "61", "patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab", "95", "CI", "65", "receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab", "compared", "receiving placebo", "p 0.001", "comparisons", "Exacerbations", "emergency visit", "hospitalization", "reduced", "group receiving intravenous mepolizumab", "61", "group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab", "week", "mean increase", "baseline in FEV1", "100 ml greater", "patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab", "receiving placebo", "p 0.02", "98 ml greater", "patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab", "receiving placebo", "p 0.03", "improvement", "baseline", "score", "6.4 points", "0 points greater", "intravenous", "subcutaneous mepolizumab groups", "placebo group", "improvement", "ACQ-5 score", "0.42 points", "0.44 points greater", "two mepolizumab groups", "placebo group", "p 0.001", "comparisons", "Conclusions", "Mepolizumab administered either", "reduced asthma exacerbations", "associated with improvements", "markers", "asthma control", "Given", "original research abstract", "following", "true", "authors", "encountered", "type 1 error"]}
