Patients with this condition typically have normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner stage 5) and normal hormone levels, as seen here. The intermittent lower abdominal pain could be due to a uterine remnant or other related issues.\n   - **C: Hyperprolactinemia**: This condition is associated with elevated prolactin levels, which are not mentioned in the problem. Additionally, it often causes low FSH and estradiol levels, which are not observed here.\n   - **D: Turner syndrome**: This condition is associated with short stature and primary amenorrhea, but patients typically have elevated FSH levels and lack normal secondary sexual characteristics, which are not consistent with this case.\n   - **E: Androgen insensitivity**: This condition is associated with a 46,XY karyotype, female external genitalia, and absent or sparse pubic/axillary hair, which is inconsistent with the presence of Tanner stage 5 pubic and axillary hair in this patient.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The most likely diagnosis is **Muellerian agenesis (Option B)**, as the clinical and laboratory findings align with this condition.\n\n### Classification:\nThe problem does not refer to or imply any missing original content, such as graphs, figures, charts, tables, or images.

{"question": "Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.\nMethods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?", "answer": "Measurement bias", "options": {"A": "Measurement bias", "B": "Recall bias", "C": "Lead-time bias", "D": "Selection bias", "E": "Length-time bias"}, "meta_info": "step2&3", "answer_idx": "A", "cleanse_cot": "### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe problem provides a detailed background, methods, results, and conclusions from a study comparing imaging methods for suspected nephrolithiasis.

{"question": "A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient’s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0–29 mm/hr).

{"question": "A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino.
