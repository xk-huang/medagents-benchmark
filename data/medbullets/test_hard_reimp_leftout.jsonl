{"realidx": 2, "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child appointment. She was delivered preterm at 35 weeks, and her medical history is significant for several ear infections over the last year. Her older brother has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the rest of her family history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient has become more withdrawn lately and has sometimes been ignoring her parents when asked to perform tasks at home. This seems to have worsened over the last 8 weeks. Otherwise, the patient is energetic and started preschool 3 months ago. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 26/min. The patient successfully draws a square and can stand on 1 foot. Her language skills are unchanged from her appointment 6 months ago.

The patient should undergo audiometry testing.\n\nHearing impairment in children can be genetic or acquired. In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss is the most common underlying cause of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment can often present similarly to behavioral or persistent developmental disorders. In a child with poor language skills, social skills, and self-isolation, hearing loss should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses. Undetected hearing loss can progress with poor academic performance, personal-social maladjustment, and emotional difficulties as children progress through critical development stages. The treatment for hearing loss is the restoration of hearing through hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other supportive measures.\n\nDammeyer et al. studied the impact of childhood hearing loss on family life. They found that children with additional disabilities were more likely to be ignored by parents. They recommend understanding family dynamics in order to better support patients and families.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer B: Autism spectrum screening questionnaire is useful in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children presenting with social isolation and poor communication skills. Autism spectrum disorder often presents with repetitive behaviors and fixed interests, which are absent in this child. Hearing loss should be ruled out first before pursuing this diagnosis. Treatment of autism spectrum disorders is early intervention and counseling.\n\nAnswer C: Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales should be obtained to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While children with ADHD often appear inattentive and impulsive in multiple domains, poor language development, and social isolation are not features of ADHD. This patient should first undergo an audiometry test. ADHD can be treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate.\n\nAnswer D: Referral for genetic testing is an incorrect first step in the management of this patient. While delayed language can be seen with several genetic conditions, there are usually signs of other global motor, cognitive, and social delays. Additional genetic testing can be pursued if the patient’s audiometry testing results are normal.\n\nAnswer E: Referral for speech and language assessment is an incorrect first step. A formal assessment should be obtained in the diagnosis of communication and language disorders. However, this should only be done after ruling out hearing loss.

{"realidx": 13, "question": "A 1-year-old girl is brought to a neurologist due to increasing seizure frequency over the past 2 months. She recently underwent a neurology evaluation which revealed hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography (EEG) with a mix of slow waves, multifocal spikes, and asynchrony. Her parents have noticed the patient occasionally stiffens and spreads her arms at home. She was born at 38-weeks gestational age without complications. She has no other medical problems.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.", "cleanse_cot": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic results (e.g., EEG findings and skin abnormalities).

Laboratory workup is performed, and the results are shown below: Serum: Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL Total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL Direct bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL Lactate dehydrogenase: 470 U/L Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 7 U/gHb (normal: 6-20 U/gHb) Which of the following would most likely be seen on a peripheral blood smear in this patient?", "answer": "Degmacytes", "options": {"A": "Acanthocytes", "B": "Codocytes", "C": "Degmacytes", "D": "Schistocytes", "E": "Spherocytes"}, "answer_idx": "C", "reason": "This patient presents with hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, elevated indirect bilirubin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase) shortly after starting a sulfa medication (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) in the setting of likely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Degmacytes (\"bite cells\") will be seen on peripheral blood smears in these patients.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia when exposed to an oxidizing substance such as sulfa drugs or fava beans. Laboratory tests will show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Since hemolysis releases intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase will be increased. Hemoglobin is then metabolized in the spleen into unconjugated bilirubin, which will cause an elevated bilirubin level that is primarily indirect. In the acute setting, G6PD levels will be normal because the most compromised cells have all been hemolyzed. Obtaining a G6PD level in between episodes of hemolysis is therefore required to observe the chronically decreased G6PD in these patients. A peripheral blood smear will reveal degmacytes (\"bite cells\") and Heinz bodies. Avoidance of oxidative stress to red blood cells is the most important component of management in these patients.\n\nBelfield and Tichy discuss the classic presentation of G6PD deficiency in patients. The authors review oxidizing medications such as rasburicase, primaquine, dapsone, pegloticase, and methylene blue. The authors recommend avoiding initiation of these medications whenever possible until a G6PD diagnostic test has been performed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acanthocytes can be seen in patients with liver disease due to defective production of lipoproteins; however, these cells do not undergo acute hemolytic destruction. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia usually present with symptoms consistent with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency such as bleeding (vitamin K) or osteoporosis (vitamin D).\n\nAnswer B: Codocytes are most commonly seen in patients with thalassemia but can also generally be seen in all microcytic anemias. Patients with thalassemia will present with chronic anemia without acute episodes of hemolysis. The increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels in this patient indicate an acute hemolytic event.\n\nAnswer D: Schistocytes can be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with TTP present with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury. DIC is a common downstream pathway for many processes such as sepsis, malignancy, and eclampsia; however, it would present with diffuse clotting and bleeding from all sites.\n\nAnswer E: Spherocytes can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which may result in hemolysis during times of acute stress; however, this patient denies symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

It presents in the first 8 weeks of life with jaundice, acholic stools, dark urine, hepatomegaly, mild transaminitis, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The definitive diagnosis is made by a cholangiogram that will demonstrate the obliteration of these ducts. Patients who are untreated experience fatal neurological defects due to kernicterus and accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. Treatment usually involves hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure), in which the duodenum is directly anastomosed to the liver. Most patients also eventually require a liver transplant.\n\nHartley et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with biliary atresia. They discuss how researchers are trying to reverse the liver fibrosis associated with this disease. They recommend early referral for a Kasai procedure or liver transplant as needed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased metabolism of bilirubin occurs with enzymatic deficiencies such as those seen in Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert syndrome. Both Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert syndromes lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (much more severe in Crigler-Najjar syndrome) rather than the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer B: Increased enterohepatic circulation describes the pathophysiology underlying breast milk jaundice. Breast milk jaundice classically peaks in the first 2 weeks of life and leads to unconjugated rather than conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment is usually supportive and patients can typically continue to breastfeed.\n\nAnswer C: Increased production of bilirubin can occur in hemolytic diseases such as G6PD deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis. These conditions would similarly lead to an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment is with addressing the underlying anemia with possible transfusion or splenectomy.\n\nAnswer E: Obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree describes Alagille syndrome, in which patients have a paucity of interlobular bile ducts.

Tourette syndrome can be medically treated with antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol.\n\nTourette syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., grimacing, sniffing) and 1 or more phonic tics (e.g., throat-clearing, barking) that occur for at least 1 year. Tics must begin before the age of 18 years, and their location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity must change over time. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are often co-morbid conditions. Common first-line treatments for Tourette syndrome-related tics include habit reversal training and alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine. However, the only pharmacologic treatments approved for Tourette syndrome in the United States are the antipsychotics haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole. Risperidone is also used due to its favorable side effect profile.\n\nSeideman and Seideman review the current treatments for Tourette syndrome. They note it is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that often occurs in children and presents with motor and phonic tics. They recommend treating with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for optimal care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors but is not approved for treatment of Tourette syndrome.

{"realidx": 58, "question": "A 52-year-old man presents to the emergency department by ambulance for evaluation of hematemesis. His wife states that he began vomiting bright red blood this evening while eating dinner, and has produced about 5 cups total. He has a history of alcohol use disorder and has vomited small streaks of blood in the past, but has never undergone formal medical workup for it. On exam, he has bright red blood in his mouth and pharynx, and also displays a distended abdomen with a fluid wave, jaundice, scattered spider angiomas, and multiple ecchymoses. His temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 98/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 22/min. A rapid point-of-care hemoglobin and platelet count is 8.8 g/dL and 80,000/mm^3, respectively. The patient is given 1L of normal saline. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?", "answer": "Octreotide", "options": {"A": "Balloon tamponade", "B": "Ceftriaxone", "C": "Nadolol", "D": "Octreotide", "E": "Platelet transfusion"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient with a history of alcohol use disorder and signs of liver failure (jaundice, ascites, spider angiomas, and ecchymoses) presents with acute hematemesis and hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) most concerning for a variceal hemorrhage. The first step in the resuscitation of patients with variceal hemorrhage is rapid administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and octreotide.\n\nEsophageal and gastric varices, most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, are abnormally distended veins that are a product of venous congestion from portal hypertension. As these varices can project into the gastrointestinal lumen, they are subject to rupture either spontaneously or by mechanical disruption (e.g., tearing by food particles). Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis as it can quickly progress to hemorrhagic shock or airway loss (if profuse vomiting is present). Patients should immediately receive 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (or central IV access) with which to administer IV fluid boluses to increase circulating volume. Blood should be transfused as needed, and a massive transfusion protocol may be needed. Patients should also be given octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, in an effort to divert blood away from the hemorrhaging varices. Other treatments that should be given include ceftriaxone (to reduce bacteremia and mortality), proton pump inhibitors, and possibly interventions such as tranexamic acid. Upper GI endoscopy and banding are the definitive therapy.\n\nStanley et al review the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding with initial IV fluid resuscitation as the first measure to achieve hemodynamic stability. They also report that for patients with cirrhosis, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide should be started as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Red blood cell transfusion is indicated at a hemoglobin transfusion of 7.0-8.0 g/dL. Definitive therapy is endoscopy with variceal ligation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon tamponade is often performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit as a temporizing measure to achieve hemostasis for patients with severe and persistent variceal hemorrhage. The balloon is inserted into the esophagus or stomach and inflated to apply direct pressure to the bleeding varices; this buys valuable time in the transition to definitive endoscopic management.\n\nAnswer B: Ceftriaxone is administered to patients with cirrhosis who present with an upper gastrointestinal bleed as a prophylactic measure against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and antibiotics should not delay initial intravenous fluid resuscitation as well as other measures to reduce and/or stop the bleeding. While this patient should receive ceftriaxone, it is more dire to first give fluids, blood, and octreotide.\n\nAnswer C: Nadolol or other nonselective beta-blocker therapy is indicated as secondary prophylaxis to prevent future bleeding episodes for patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage. Non-selective beta blockers such as nadolol decrease portal pressure, but are contraindicated in the acute setting as they could exacerbate hypovolemic shock by reducing cardiac output.\n\nAnswer D: Platelet transfusion is required for patients with variceal hemorrhage with an initial platelet count < 50,000/mm^3, and for those who receive a significant amount of blood products during their resuscitation (significant dilutional thrombocytopenia can occur after 10-12 units of transfused red blood cells). This patient's platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3, and he has not yet received blood products.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of a cirrhosis patient with acute variceal hemorrhage is the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, symptoms, physical exam findings, vital signs, and laboratory results.

This can lead to hyperlipidemia (due to loss of lipoproteins), hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III and protein C/S), and hypoalbuminemia. Most serum calcium is bound to albumin, so when albumin is lost in the urine, it can lead to profound hypocalcemia. The ionized or free portion of calcium remains the same; therefore, these patients do not exhibit symptoms of hypocalcemia. Furthermore, the loss of albumin will reduce the oncotic pressure in the vessels resulting in massive extravasation of fluid and anasarca.\n\nAmbler et al. report a case of a patient who presented with a DVT and was found to have nephrotic syndrome. They discuss how the patient had asymptomatic changes in lab values including calcium. They recommend performing a urine dipstick for protein in cases of suspected nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antithrombin III deficiency is a common cause of a hypercoagulable state because antithrombin III normally helps to neutralize coagulation factors. This disease is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT as it predisposes patients to thrombotic events; however, it does not explain her profound hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic antithrombin III deficiency does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer B: Factor V Leiden is the most common cause of a hypercoagulable state because this mutation renders factor V unable to be inactivated by proteins C and S. This is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT; however, it does not explain her hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic factor V Leiden mutation does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer D: Liver dysfunction is possible given this patient's history of alcohol use and IV drug abuse, placing her at risk for chronic hepatitis C infection. Despite the anasarca, this patient has no other stigmata of liver failure such as jaundice or ascites, making nephrotic syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer E: Prothrombin gene mutation could explain this patient's hypercoagulable state because high levels of this gene can result in unprovoked thrombotic events.

Typical episodes last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks may be associated with the circadian rhythm, as patients may notice that they get headaches at night. Because of the extreme pain, cluster headaches are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"suicide\" headaches. These headaches may present with autonomic symptoms, such as lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Horner syndrome may also occur, defined by a unilateral triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Acute management of cluster headaches includes administration of 100% oxygen. Other options include triptans. The first-line medication for prophylaxis of cluster headaches is verapamil.

These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemophilia A caused by factor 8 deficiency.\n\nHemophilia is a deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B). Common symptoms of hemophilia include hemarthrosis, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. Laboratory testing is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as hemophilia is characterized by an isolated prolongation of PTT without a change in PT. The factors involved in hemophilia participate only in the indirect cascade of coagulation factor activation. Similarly, since bleeding time depends only upon platelet function and not coagulation factors, hemophilia presents with a normal bleeding time. Treatment of hemophilia includes desmopressin in mild cases and factor replacement in moderate to severe disease.\n\nBerntorp et al. present a review of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. They discuss how these patients now have normal life expectancies with the advent of factor replacement therapy. They recommend being vigilant for the development of anti-factor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-platelet antibodies are responsible for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This disease is caused by autoimmune antibody formation that damages platelets and causes them to be removed by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. It usually occurs in children after an acute viral infection and it presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces with laboratory findings showing an increased bleeding time, decreased platelets, and a normal PT/PTT.\n\nAnswer C: Factor 9 deficiency (hemophilia B) presents nearly identically to hemophilia A with a normal PT, prolonged PTT, and normal bleeding time with a history of bleeding in male relatives. However, because hemophilia B is epidemiologically less common than hemophilia A, hemophilia A is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer D: GP1b deficiency causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by unusually large platelets and a low platelet count. Like von Willebrand disease (vWD), patients often present with cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, abnormal bleeding from minor trauma, and a prolonged bleeding time, which this patient does not have. It can be distinguished from vWD by a ristocetin assay. Treatment can include tranexamic acid.\n\nAnswer E: Von Willebrand factor deficiency results in vWD, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Unlike this patient, patients with vWD also present with a prolonged bleeding time. Patients with vWD will also have an increased PT because this factor is responsible for stabilizing coagulation factor 8.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHemophilia A is caused by factor 8 deficiency and presents with hemarthrosis, frequent bruising, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal bleeding with a prolonged PTT with a normal PT and bleeding time.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results.

A detailed workup is not needed if the clinical story is clear, but an orthostatic test can be completed. One way to do this is to assess the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon. Another way requires the patient to collect urine at multiple times throughout the day. A diagnosis is confirmed if the morning sample is protein-free but the evening sample contains protein. In general, pediatric patients with orthostatic proteinuria should have under 1 gram of protein in a full 24 hours.

Symptoms include bulbar muscle weakness and type 2 respiratory failure (inadequate alveolar ventilation). The most appropriate initial step in management is to maintain adequate respiratory function by intubation. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is used to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from circulation, and steroids are started for long-term therapy.

A cholinergic crisis is an acute exacerbation of muscle weakness due to over-medication with cholinergic anti-cholinesterases. This disease would present with diarrhea, sweating, miosis, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. It rarely occurs with proper dosing of pyridostigmine.\n\nAnswer B: Edrophonium can be used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor.

Zinc deficiency is common in patients with poor nutritional status such as the homeless, individuals living in developing nations without access to food, and patients with eating disorders. Many malabsorptive conditions can cause zinc deficiency including steatorrhea and chronic pancreatitis. Zinc deficiency presents with impaired wound healing and impaired immune function. Other symptoms suggestive of zinc deficiency include xerosis, alopecia, stomatitis, oral ulceration, angular cheilitis, impaired vision (night blindness), impaired smell/taste, diarrhea, and anorexia. The treatment of zinc deficiency involves zinc supplementation and workup for any other nutritional deficiencies.\n\nNagata etc al. study the incidence of zinc deficiency among younger patients with anorexia nervosa. The authors find that men and women are both equally likely to have zinc deficiency when admitted.

Risk factors for AAA include advanced age (> 60 years), smoking history, male sex, and history of atherosclerosis. AAA can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic until it markedly expands or ruptures, leading to abdominal pain, back pain, or flank pain. The evaluation of suspected AAA depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the existence of an AAA. A hemodynamically unstable patient with a known history of AAA should be assumed to have a ruptured AAA and undergo surgical intervention without further workup (though bedside ultrasound can support the diagnosis). In an unstable patient without a known history, a bedside ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis should precede surgical intervention. In a hemodynamically stable patient with or without a known AAA history, an abdominal CTA is appropriate.\n\nSakalihasan et al. present a review of the presentation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. They discuss how patients are often asymptomatic until catastrophic rupture occurs. They recommend immediate surgical repair of the aneurysm during ruptures to prevent death.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer A: Acute pancreatitis also presents with abdominal pain and can present with hemodynamic instability in severe cases of hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis. This is a rare entity and is less likely in this patient. Treatment is immediate transcatheter arterial embolization for unstable patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer B: Aortic dissection has similar risk factors to AAA (history of hypertension, advanced age) and also presents with acute onset back pain.

{"realidx": 212, "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with a recurrent episode of syncope. He states that this has happened to him multiple times, particularly when he changes body position from sitting to standing, exerts himself, or turns his head quickly. He says that he notes numbness, vertigo, and sometimes even trouble with speaking immediately prior to fainting. The episodes usually last 1-5 minutes. When he wakes up, he is mildly confused but typically returns to baseline within a minute. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 153/89 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's neurological exam is unremarkable. However, when he is asked to stand up and start walking, he experiences the same numbness and tingling and feels like he may faint. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Blood vessel narrowing", "options": {"A": "Blood vessel narrowing", "B": "Cardiac dysrhythmia", "C": "Seizure", "D": "Stroke", "E": "Vagal event"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This elderly patient with risk factors for vascular disease (diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension) is presenting with episodes of dizziness, vertigo, numbness/tingling, dysarthria, and syncope, which seem to be provoked by standing rapidly and changing head position. This is concerning for vertebrobasilar syndrome, caused by blood vessel narrowing.\n\nVertebrobasilar syndrome is caused by narrowing (via causes such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or congenital narrowing among others) of the vertebrobasilar vascular system. It is a common cause of syncope that may be worsened by changes in head position or standing rapidly. Other unique features include numbness/tingling, a sensation of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Note the episodes of syncope in this condition are intermittent and specifically provoked and do not have lasting/permanent neurological deficits in contrast to a stroke. Management is first centered on vascular imaging which may include a CTA head/neck or an MRA head/neck. Further care depends on the symptoms present but typically involves smoking cessation, glycemic control, blood pressure control, aspirin, and a statin.\n\nXuan-Ting et al. review posterior circulation strokes which occur more frequently in patients with atherosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar system. They note that MRI is one of the most accurate tests for assessing posterior circulation strokes which may present with dizziness and syncope. It is far superior to CT imaging. For this reason, they recommend that CT imaging alone cannot definitively rule out a posterior circulation stroke.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia can cause sudden onset and offset syncope without prodromal symptoms. The differentiating feature of this form of syncope is the rapid onset and offset in a high-risk patient. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an ECG; however, many patients will require prolonged observation on telemetry.\n\nAnswer C: Seizure presents with impaired consciousness, tonic-clonic activity, and a post-ictal state which gradually improves over hours. The lactate may be elevated after a seizure, and the prolactin level is a more specific indicator of a seizure. However, the diagnosis is most appropriately made based on history, exam, and EEG.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke involving the vertebrobasilar system may cause syncope in addition to ongoing dizziness and vertigo with ataxia. However, this patient's symptoms seem to be positional and have entirely resolved; thus, a stroke is unlikely. He is at higher risk of stroke given his vertebrobasilar insufficiency and an MRI should still be performed in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Vagal event presents with a warm prodrome with palpitations, flushing, and syncope.

In patients without significant trauma, the presence of signs of spinal cord compression (e.g., urinary retention, bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia, focal neurologic deficits), history of or strong risk factors for cancer, signs of infection, or risk of vertebral compression fracture should prompt additional work-up with imaging such as radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging.

The clear association of her back pain with exertion makes lumbosacral strain more likely.\n\nAnswer D: Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebral body is forwardly subluxated relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This presents as back pain alleviated by rest. Since this can narrow the spinal canal, it may also present with neurogenic claudication, manifesting as buttock or leg pain with walking that can be alleviated by bending forward. This patient’s back pain is not alleviated by rest and is associated with exertion.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fractures can present as back pain in a patient with minor or no trauma. These patients have osteoporosis and other risk factors like advanced age or chronic corticosteroid use and would have point tenderness at the site of fracture.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic results.

His mother has tried increasing the frequency of feeds and decreasing the amount of each feed, but the vomiting seems to be getting worse. The patient now vomits after every feed. The vomitus looks like breast milk. The patient’s mother is exclusively breastfeeding and would prefer not to switch to formula but worries that the patient is not getting the nutrition he needs.

The most appropriate next step in management is abdominal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPyloric stenosis presents in 4- to 6-week-old infants with nonbilious, post-prandial projectile vomiting. Although pyloric stenosis classically presents with an “olive-shaped” mass in the epigastrium, the mass cannot be palpated in some patients. Any infant who develops new, persistent vomiting in the first 2 months of life and has associated dehydration or failure to thrive should undergo an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for pyloric stenosis. Patients should undergo resuscitation prior to the definitive treatment, which is a pyloromyotomy.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction. They discuss how malrotation, jejunoileal atresia, duodenal atresia, and colonic atresia are common causes of this finding. They recommend surgical management of these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is not helpful in evaluating for pyloric stenosis. It is more useful in the workup of bilious vomiting, as several etiologies of bilious vomiting (such as duodenal atresia and Hirschsprung disease) can be seen on an abdominal radiograph. Treatment of these conditions is surgical excision of the defective segment of colon.\n\nAnswer C: Supplementing breastfeeding with formula would not be appropriate for this patient as his failure to thrive is driven by gastric outlet obstruction.

He started taking fluoxetine 3 weeks ago when he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder after a divorce. Since then, he notes that his symptoms are roughly unchanged. His other medications include albuterol. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 132/88 mmHg, pulse is 77/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a depressed affect. His neurologic exam is non-focal. A serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulted from his last visit and is noted to be 4.8 µU/mL (normal: 0.5-5 µU/mL). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?", "answer": "Maintain dose of current medication", "options": {"A": "Administer levothyroxine", "B": "Change medication to bupropion", "C": "Change medication to escitalopram", "D": "Increase dose of current medication", "E": "Maintain dose of current medication"}, "answer_idx": "E", "reason": "This patient is presenting with major depressive disorder but has not given his current selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at least 4 weeks to begin working. Thus, he should be reassured and maintained on the current dose of his SSRI, with follow-up after the 4 week mark to see if his symptoms have improved.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is managed initially with cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. The typical first-line medication is an SSRI. SSRIs may take at least 4 weeks or more to begin working, so patients that return before this time period should be reassured and encouraged to let the medication take effect as long as they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts or intent. If the medication is not working after at least 4 weeks, the next steps in management could include increasing the dose of the current medication, changing SSRIs, adding another antidepressant agent, or adding a low dose of levothyroxine. All patients with suicidal ideation and either intent or a plan to hurt themselves should be hospitalized involuntarily.\n\nGautam et al. discuss the current management algorithms for major depressive disorder. They note different options including CBT and pharmacotherapy. They recommend appropriate treatment with a first-line agent based on the patient and their circumstances.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering levothyroxine is appropriate as an augmenting agent in patients who do not have an improvement in symptoms on SSRIs or other antidepressants even if their TSH is within the normal range. However, it would not be attempted at this point given this patient has not given his current medication sufficient time to begin working. There is limited evidence to support its use overall. Note that this patient's TSH is within normal limits. In some cases, T3 administration is used in refractory depression.\n\nAnswer B: Changing the medication to bupropion could be appropriate in patients who want to avoid weight gain, those who want to quit smoking, or those who are trying to avoid sexual side effects. It also is an appropriate second-line agent or could be added to a first-line agent; however, this patient’s current medication should be tried for at least 4 weeks before changing medications.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Changing medication to escitalopram or increasing the dose of the current medication are both viable strategies if a patient has failed to improve on their first medication after at least 4 weeks on the medication.

His elevated troponin is likely secondary to poor renal clearance and dehydration, which is most appropriately addressed with IV fluids such as Ringer lactate.\n\nTroponin is a lab marker classically thought to be elevated when there is an injury to the heart causing leakage of this enzyme from the cardiac myocyte. However, there are many possible causes of an elevated troponin that may not be directly cardiac in nature or related to myocardial ischemia. Acute kidney injury is a common cause of an elevated troponin. For this reason, patients with an elevated troponin with kidney dysfunction without any cardiac symptoms or ECG changes should have their renal etiology addressed, and this will often clear the troponin. In the setting of a prerenal injury (dehydration causing poor kidney perfusion and a BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1), IV fluids will restore perfusion and treat the underlying cause. Patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure should have an ECG obtained and their current troponin should be compared to previous troponin levels to ensure it is not higher than their baseline. If there is uncertainty regarding a troponin level, it can be trended to see if it is rising, falling, or staying the same. Correlation with clinical symptoms is important when evaluating an elevated troponin level.\n\nMasri et al. review the causes of an elevated troponin. They note that a troponin elevation can be seen in myopericarditis, renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, rhabdomyolysis, stroke, and many other possible causes that are not related to myocardial infarction. They recommend keeping a broad differential and correlating the troponin with the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin would be appropriate management of an elevated troponin secondary to acute coronary syndrome as its antiplatelet activity reduces mortality. It should be administered prior to performing an ECG in patients with chest pain thought to be from a cardiac etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization is appropriate management of a ST elevation myocardial infarction, which presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and ST elevation within a vascular distribution with reciprocal changes on ECG. This patient has no cardiac symptoms and has a better alternative explanation for their troponin elevation.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol and aspirin may be indicated in acute coronary syndrome, and metoprolol would reduce this patient's heart rate. However, note that this patient's tachycardia is secondary to volume depletion; thus, beta-blockade for sinus tachycardia is inappropriate and may make the patient hemodynamically unstable.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a urinalysis and creatine phosphokinase level may be performed in rhabdomyolysis which presents in the setting of seizures, electrical shock, heatstroke, or with vigorous exertion. Patients will complain of muscle pain, oliguria, and dark urine. Management is centered on the administration of large volumes of fluid to protect the kidney and clear the toxic myoglobin. Note that rhabdomyolysis may elevate the troponin; however, there is nothing in this patient's history that suggests rhabdomyolysis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPrerenal injury causing an acute kidney injury may elevate the troponin due to decreased renal clearance and should be addressed with the administration of fluids.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results.

The outpouching can often collect and store urine, resulting in slow postvoid dribbling and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urethral diverticula can often be associated with expressed purulent or bloody discharge on exam. Initial workup includes urinalysis and transvaginal ultrasound. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a pelvic MRI before referral for surgical excision.\n\nGreiman et al. review urethral diverticula and its treatment. They note that surgical repair is challenging. However, it is still recommended to perform surgery in appropriate candidates.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Overflow incontinence (caused by impaired detrusor activity or bladder outlet obstruction) can also present with involuntary loss of urine due to urinary retention. However, this patient’s normal postvoid residual volume (< 150 mL) makes this an unlikely diagnosis. Patients will often present with a constant dribbling of urine and a sensation of incomplete voiding.\n\nAnswer B: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs due to weakened pelvic support and increased intraabdominal pressure and can be exacerbated by increasing parity. While it can also present with incontinence, physical exam often reveals a bulging mass that increases with Valsava maneuver - a finding that is absent in this patient.\n\nAnswer C: Stress urinary incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility leading to urinary leakage from increased intraabdominal pressure.
