{"question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child appointment. She was delivered preterm at 35 weeks, and her medical history is significant for several ear infections over the last year. Her older brother has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the rest of her family history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient has become more withdrawn lately and has sometimes been ignoring her parents when asked to perform tasks at home. This seems to have worsened over the last 8 weeks. Otherwise, the patient is energetic and started preschool 3 months ago. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 26/min. The patient successfully draws a square and can stand on 1 foot. Her language skills are unchanged from her appointment 6 months ago.

The patient should undergo audiometry testing.\n\nHearing impairment in children can be genetic or acquired. In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss is the most common underlying cause of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment can often present similarly to behavioral or persistent developmental disorders. In a child with poor language skills, social skills, and self-isolation, hearing loss should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses. Undetected hearing loss can progress with poor academic performance, personal-social maladjustment, and emotional difficulties as children progress through critical development stages. The treatment for hearing loss is the restoration of hearing through hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other supportive measures.\n\nDammeyer et al. studied the impact of childhood hearing loss on family life. They found that children with additional disabilities were more likely to be ignored by parents. They recommend understanding family dynamics in order to better support patients and families.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer B: Autism spectrum screening questionnaire is useful in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children presenting with social isolation and poor communication skills. Autism spectrum disorder often presents with repetitive behaviors and fixed interests, which are absent in this child. Hearing loss should be ruled out first before pursuing this diagnosis. Treatment of autism spectrum disorders is early intervention and counseling.\n\nAnswer C: Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales should be obtained to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While children with ADHD often appear inattentive and impulsive in multiple domains, poor language development, and social isolation are not features of ADHD. This patient should first undergo an audiometry test. ADHD can be treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate.\n\nAnswer D: Referral for genetic testing is an incorrect first step in the management of this patient.

Additional genetic testing can be pursued if the patient\u2019s audiometry testing results are normal.\n\nAnswer E: Referral for speech and language assessment is an incorrect first step. A formal assessment should be obtained in the diagnosis of communication and language disorders. However, this should only be done after ruling out hearing loss.

An insulinoma is a beta cell tumor that secretes insulin.\n\nAn insulinoma is a beta cell tumor of the pancreas. The beta cells normally secrete insulin in response to increased circulating fuel substrate (such as glucose or fat). In the setting of an insulinoma, insulin is pathologically and continuously secreted. This leads to profound, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. When a patient presents with hypoglycemia of unclear etiology; a blood glucose level, C-peptide level, and sulfonylurea level should be ordered. An infectious workup may be indicated as sepsis can also cause hypoglycemia. In an insulinoma, patients will be hypoglycemic, have an elevated C-peptide level (as this is a marker of endogenous insulin release), and a negative sulfonylurea level (important to rule out as a sulfonylurea overdose can also cause hypoglycemia in the setting of an elevated C-peptide level). Further workup will involve imaging of the abdomen such as a CT scan or MRI (more accurate) to delineate this insulin-secreting mass.\n\nMathur et al. discuss insulinoma. They note that it is a rare endocrine tumor, and note its association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. They recommend workup for an insulinoma should occur in patients with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia without a clear cause.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alpha cell tumor describes a glucagonoma, which pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia, a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema (presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques), and gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\nAnswer B: Beta cell destruction describes the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus, which presents in pediatric patients (most commonly) with hyperglycemia, weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria. Treatment involves the administration of insulin. An initial presentation of type I diabetes may be diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, Kussmaul respirations, and an anion gap acidosis.\n\nAnswer D: Insulin overdose would present with hypoglycemia, somnolence, confusion, and tremulousness. Note that exogenous insulin administration would not elevate the C-peptide level, which is a marker of endogenous insulin production.\n\nAnswer E: Sulfonylurea overdose would cause hypoglycemia that is often persistent given the long half-life of sulfonylureas. It would also elevate the C-peptide level as these medications increase the endogenous release of insulin. However, the sulfonylurea level was negative in this patient. While iatrogenic use of medications is plausible in this patient who has knowledge of medications (as she is a nurse), her repeat episodes and her workup suggesting against an iatrogenic etiology makes an insulinoma a more likely diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nInsulinomas are beta cell tumors of the pancreas and lead to severe hypoglycemia and an elevated insulin and C-peptide level.", "realidx": 7, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results.

Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding.

Degmacytes (\"bite cells\") will be seen on peripheral blood smears in these patients.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia when exposed to an oxidizing substance such as sulfa drugs or fava beans. Laboratory tests will show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Since hemolysis releases intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase will be increased. Hemoglobin is then metabolized in the spleen into unconjugated bilirubin, which will cause an elevated bilirubin level that is primarily indirect. In the acute setting, G6PD levels will be normal because the most compromised cells have all been hemolyzed. Obtaining a G6PD level in between episodes of hemolysis is therefore required to observe the chronically decreased G6PD in these patients. A peripheral blood smear will reveal degmacytes (\"bite cells\") and Heinz bodies. Avoidance of oxidative stress to red blood cells is the most important component of management in these patients.\n\nBelfield and Tichy discuss the classic presentation of G6PD deficiency in patients.

Patients with thalassemia will present with chronic anemia without acute episodes of hemolysis. The increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels in this patient indicate an acute hemolytic event.\n\nAnswer D: Schistocytes can be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with TTP present with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury. DIC is a common downstream pathway for many processes such as sepsis, malignancy, and eclampsia; however, it would present with diffuse clotting and bleeding from all sites.\n\nAnswer E: Spherocytes can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which may result in hemolysis during times of acute stress; however, this patient denies symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

{"question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for palpitations. For 2 months, she has experienced intermittent palpitations along with menstrual irregularity and hair loss. At home, the air conditioner is at its coldest setting, but the patient still feels overheated.

She is given atenolol in the emergency department with improvement of her palpitations and is instructed to follow up with her primary doctor for further management. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient after definitive treatment of her condition?", "answer": "Exophthalmos", "options": {"A": "Exophthalmos", "B": "Hair loss", "C": "Heat intolerance", "D": "Menstrual irregularity", "E": "Thyromegaly"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This patient presents with palpitations, tachycardia, tremor, heat intolerance, hair loss, menstrual irregularity, goiter, and exophthalmos concerning for hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease. Radioiodine ablation is the preferred definitive management for Graves disease, which can worsen exophthalmos.\n\nGraves disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroid disorder caused by antibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which induce production of T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). Overstimulation of the thyroid gland by TSHR antibodies results in diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, termed \u201cgoiter.\u201d TSHR is also highly expressed in retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts, where overstimulation by TSHR antibodies (and activated T-cells) leads to the expansion of retro-ocular connective tissue and extra-ocular muscle volume. This causes exophthalmos (bulging eyes) and is referred to as Graves ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy. Beta blockers are used to achieve acute sympathetic control in hyperthyroid Graves patients, and antithyroid medications (propylthiouracil or methimazole) are initiated to achieve a euthyroid state. Radioactive iodine ablation is first-line definitive management, particularly, for individuals with unsuccessful anti-thyroid medication management. Radioiodine ablation has been known to increase TSHR-antibodies, likely secondary to the leakage of thyroid antigens, and thus exophthalmos is often worsened after treatment. For this reason, corticosteroids are often co-administrated as a prophylactic measure.\n\nDavies et al. review Graves disease including the pathophysiology and management. They note that Graves orbitopathy may be worsened by radioiodine ablation. They recommend further studies and advancements in care given this lasting complication.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Hair loss can occur in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid states due to altered hair follicle stem cell function. However, this process is typically reversed, not worsened, after achieving a euthyroid state.\n\nAnswer C: Heat intolerance occurs in Graves disease due to hyperthyroid-induced sympathetic overactivity, which resolves after successful treatment.\n\nAnswer D: Menstrual irregularity occurs in hyperthyroidism through altered levels of sex hormone binding globulin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and prolactin. However, treatment of hyperthyroidism typically restores menstrual regularity. After ablation, patients will be hypothyroid; however, the standard of care is to start the patient on levothyroxine which should prevent this complication.\n\nAnswer E: Thyromegaly in Graves disease is caused by diffuse overactivation of the thyroid gland by the TSHR antibodies. Once treated with radioactive iodine (I-131), the thyroid gland gradually shrinks in size. Patients who undergo radioactive iodine ablation will later require life-long thyroxine supplementation due to resulting hypothyroidism.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDefinitive therapy for Graves disease is radioiodine ablation, which leads to increased TSHR antibodies and worsened exophthalmos from overactivation of TSHR-rich retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts.", "realidx": 12, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 30-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, menstrual irregularity, hair loss, heat intolerance, tachycardia, tremors, thyromegaly, and exophthalmos.

{"question": "A 1-year-old girl is brought to a neurologist due to increasing seizure frequency over the past 2 months. She recently underwent a neurology evaluation which revealed hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography (EEG) with a mix of slow waves, multifocal spikes, and asynchrony. Her parents have noticed the patient occasionally stiffens and spreads her arms at home. She was born at 38-weeks gestational age without complications. She has no other medical problems. Her medications consist of lamotrigine and valproic acid. Her temperature is 98.3\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/75 mmHg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam reveals innumerable hypopigmented macules on the skin and an irregularly shaped, thickened, and elevated plaque on the lower back. Which of the following is most strongly associated with this patient's condition?", "answer": "Cardiac rhabdomyoma", "options": {"A": "Cardiac rhabdomyoma", "B": "Glaucoma", "C": "Optic glioma", "D": "Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia", "E": "Renal cell carcinoma"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This patient with a seizure disorder, ash-leaf spots (innumerable hypopigmented macules), Shagreen patch (elevated irregular plaque on the lower back), and West syndrome (hypsarrhythmia on EEG and movements consistent with infantile spasms) likely has tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.", "realidx": 13, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 1-year-old girl with specific symptoms and findings.

{"question": "A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband with a 1 hour history of an unremitting headache. The headache started suddenly while she was eating dinner and she says it feels like the \u201cworst headache of my life.\u201d An emergent CT scan of the head without contrast confirms the diagnosis, and a CT angiogram identifies the source of bleeding. The patient undergoes surgical management of her condition. On hospital day 3, she is found to be disoriented to person, place, and time. She also develops nausea and vomiting. Her medical problems consist of heart failure for which she takes furosemide, spironolactone, and metoprolol, which were continued at admission. Her temperature is 99.6\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows poor skin turgor.

In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia.

Supervising physicians must obtain informed consent from the patient while alive and with capacity or from a newly deceased patient\u2019s healthcare proxy or family. During the consent process, the supervisor should outline the patient's and family's rights, wider educational and societal benefits, potential risks, and ensure that performing the procedure would be consistent with the patient's values and wishes.

The most accurate diagnostic test for early ankylosing spondylitis is MRI.\n\nMultiple imaging tests can diagnose ankylosing spondylitis. Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance. The earliest radiographic sign is the erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease. MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therapy for patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs includes tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and interleukin 17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab).\n\nJung et al. studied whether signs of inflammation on MRI are correlated with bone quality in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemophilia A caused by factor 8 deficiency.\n\nHemophilia is a deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B). Common symptoms of hemophilia include hemarthrosis, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. Laboratory testing is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as hemophilia is characterized by an isolated prolongation of PTT without a change in PT. The factors involved in hemophilia participate only in the indirect cascade of coagulation factor activation. Similarly, since bleeding time depends only upon platelet function and not coagulation factors, hemophilia presents with a normal bleeding time. Treatment of hemophilia includes desmopressin in mild cases and factor replacement in moderate to severe disease.\n\nBerntorp et al. present a review of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. They discuss how these patients now have normal life expectancies with the advent of factor replacement therapy. They recommend being vigilant for the development of anti-factor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-platelet antibodies are responsible for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This disease is caused by autoimmune antibody formation that damages platelets and causes them to be removed by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. It usually occurs in children after an acute viral infection and it presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces with laboratory findings showing an increased bleeding time, decreased platelets, and a normal PT/PTT.\n\nAnswer C: Factor 9 deficiency (hemophilia B) presents nearly identically to hemophilia A with a normal PT, prolonged PTT, and normal bleeding time with a history of bleeding in male relatives. However, because hemophilia B is epidemiologically less common than hemophilia A, hemophilia A is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer D: GP1b deficiency causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by unusually large platelets and a low platelet count. Like von Willebrand disease (vWD), patients often present with cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, abnormal bleeding from minor trauma, and a prolonged bleeding time, which this patient does not have. It can be distinguished from vWD by a ristocetin assay. Treatment can include tranexamic acid.\n\nAnswer E: Von Willebrand factor deficiency results in vWD, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Unlike this patient, patients with vWD also present with a prolonged bleeding time. Patients with vWD will also have an increased PT because this factor is responsible for stabilizing coagulation factor 8.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHemophilia A is caused by factor 8 deficiency and presents with hemarthrosis, frequent bruising, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal bleeding with a prolonged PTT with a normal PT and bleeding time.", "realidx": 19, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory test results.

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance.

{"question": "A 7-year-old boy presents to the emergency department after an episode of jerking his extremities followed by confusion. This has happened in the past, but his mother thought he was fabricating his symptoms. She has taken him to a free health clinic to have him seen by a doctor who prescribed medication; however, she has been unable to fill the prescription. He has had an MRI of the brain with no acute findings in the past. The mother states this episode lasted about 3 minutes and involved full-body jerking. After the episode, the child was non-responsive but was breathing on his own. The child has a history of migraine headaches with aura that resolve with ibuprofen. He is otherwise healthy and has no medical problems or recent illness and is up to date on his vaccinations.

He initially is unable to move his left upper and lower extremity and has a left facial droop; however, after a few minutes, he has 4/5 strength in the affected side with resolution of his facial weakness. The mother notes that this is similar to his past episodes.

Given that the patient is not moving the left side of his body, he is likely suffering from Todd paralysis, which can occur after seizures and resolves on its own with only observation.\n\nA generalized tonic-clonic seizure may present with full-body tonic-clonic activity with altered mental status. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, patients can be postictal and appear to be obtunded. Other than ensuring adequate oxygenation/ventilation and evaluating for the cause of the seizure, there is no further intervention needed as this postictal state will improve with time. After seizures, some patients present with Todd paralysis, which is a focal paralysis after a seizure. This may mimic a stroke, and thus the patient\u2019s risk factors and known seizure history should be factored into the decision. Todd paralysis does not require any intervention and will improve with time and observation only.\n\nXu et al. review Todd paralysis. They note that Todd paralysis is characterized by temporary limb weakness or hemiplegia and usually occurs following a seizure. They recommend that it can be difficult to differentiate Todd paralysis from a stroke in certain patient populations.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnswer A: Alteplase is a thrombolytic that could be used in an acute ischemic stroke if given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset without any contraindications to its use. It would only be given after the CT scan of the head has been performed and other reversible causes have been addressed in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Alteplase is not given when neurologic symptoms are thought to be secondary to Todd paralysis. In fact, seizure and Todd paralysis would be a contraindication to thrombolytic use in stroke.\n\nAnswer B: CT head, in addition to a fingerstick blood glucose, should immediately be performed in all patients with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits thought to be secondary to a stroke. A stroke would present with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits. However, it is common for patients to be obtunded and have focal neurologic deficits after a seizure and this would not warrant a stroke workup unless clinical suspicion exists. This patient has no risk factors for stroke and his improving strength suggests against a stroke. Moreover, he has a history of a normal MRI of the brain.\n\nAnswer C: Diazepam would only be given for a patient who is actively seizing as it is a benzodiazepine with a long half-life. Note that it is not indicated in a postictal patient as there is no ongoing seizure. Benzodiazepines are not given as preventive measures for seizures.\n\nAnswer E: Sumatriptan may be indicated to treat a migraine, which presents with a pulsatile, unilateral headache and is more common in women. Hemiplegic migraine can cause focal neurologic deficits, and it would be reasonable to treat a migraine headache if a patient had focal neurologic deficits and a history of known hemiplegic migraines.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?", "answer": "Haloperidol", "options": {"A": "Clozapine", "B": "Dextroamphetamine", "C": "Fluoxetine", "D": "Haloperidol", "E": "Methylphenidate"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient presents with multiple motor tics (grimacing, eye blinking) and phonic tics (barking, throat-clearing) on a daily basis for more than 1 year, which are consistent with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome can be medically treated with antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol.\n\nTourette syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., grimacing, sniffing) and 1 or more phonic tics (e.g., throat-clearing, barking) that occur for at least 1 year. Tics must begin before the age of 18 years, and their location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity must change over time. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are often co-morbid conditions. Common first-line treatments for Tourette syndrome-related tics include habit reversal training and alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine. However, the only pharmacologic treatments approved for Tourette syndrome in the United States are the antipsychotics haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole. Risperidone is also used due to its favorable side effect profile.\n\nSeideman and Seideman review the current treatments for Tourette syndrome. They note it is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that often occurs in children and presents with motor and phonic tics. They recommend treating with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for optimal care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors but is not approved for treatment of Tourette syndrome. It is typically avoided due to the risk for agranulocytosis and is mainly used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia as a last-line agent. Weight gain is another significant side-effect.\n\nAnswer B: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant commonly used for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD can be comorbid with Tourette syndrome but presents with hyperactivity (e.g., fidgeting, difficulty taking turns, blurting out answers) and/or inattentive symptoms (e.g., daydreaming, difficulty completing tasks) in at least 2 settings. While this patient\u2019s phonic tics are disruptive, he has no difficulty waiting his turn and completing his chores, making Tourette syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer C: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may be used for the treatment of OCD. OCD is often co-morbid with Tourette syndrome but compulsions are present, which manifest as repetitive counting, hoarding, tapping, or error checking. This patient\u2019s behavior is better attributed to his tics rather than compulsions.\n\nAnswer E: Methylphenidate is a stimulant used for the treatment of ADHD.

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium.

Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case.

It presents in the first 8 weeks of life with jaundice, acholic stools, dark urine, hepatomegaly, mild transaminitis, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The definitive diagnosis is made by a cholangiogram that will demonstrate the obliteration of these ducts. Patients who are untreated experience fatal neurological defects due to kernicterus and accumulation of bilirubin in the brain.

They discuss how researchers are trying to reverse the liver fibrosis associated with this disease. They recommend early referral for a Kasai procedure or liver transplant as needed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased metabolism of bilirubin occurs with enzymatic deficiencies such as those seen in Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert syndrome. Both Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert syndromes lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (much more severe in Crigler-Najjar syndrome) rather than the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer B: Increased enterohepatic circulation describes the pathophysiology underlying breast milk jaundice. Breast milk jaundice classically peaks in the first 2 weeks of life and leads to unconjugated rather than conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment is usually supportive and patients can typically continue to breastfeed.\n\nAnswer C: Increased production of bilirubin can occur in hemolytic diseases such as G6PD deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis. These conditions would similarly lead to an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment is with addressing the underlying anemia with possible transfusion or splenectomy.\n\nAnswer E: Obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree describes Alagille syndrome, in which patients have a paucity of interlobular bile ducts.

While most patients are asymptomatic, there can be pulmonary and intestinal manifestations in the early and late phases, respectively. Pulmonary signs include dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and wheezing. Intestinal signs include abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, and/or anorexia. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with vague abdominal symptoms with travel history to an endemic area. The diagnosis is secured with stool microscopy for eggs or worms. Complications of this condition include intestinal obstruction or hepatobiliary/pancreatic involvement, presenting as biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and/or ascending cholangitis. Treatment in patients with uncomplicated infection is with anti-helminth therapy (albendazole or mebendazole).\n\nParija et al. review the epidemiology of helminth infections globally.

A urine chloride test can be used to distinguish between these possibilities because urine chloride will be high in diuretic abuse and will be low/normal in surreptitious vomiting.\n\nMetabolic alkalosis is an acid-base disorder that is due to an increased level of serum bicarbonate. This increase can be secondary to increased bicarbonate intake or loss of hydrogen ions. Etiologies consistent with increased intake include antacid use or milk-alkali syndrome. Etiologies consistent with hydrogen ion loss include gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting or renal losses such as hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Urine chloride can distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal losses because urine chloride levels will be high in patients with renal tubule dysfunction or diuretic abuse. This is due to increased urinary excretion of ammonium chloride in cases of diarrhea. On the other hand, urine chloride will generally be low in hyperaldosteronism due to loss of chloride with vomiting.\n\nWu et al. studied the causes of chronic hypokalemia as well as laboratory findings that can be used to distinguish between different etiologies. They show how urine sodium and chloride can be helpful for identifying the surreptitious use of diuretics. The authors recommend the use of the sodium-to-chloride excretion ratio to help diagnose patients with chronic normotensive hypokalemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Arterial blood gas is useful for determining the acid-base state of a patient because it simultaneously measures carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. This test is not as useful in determining different causes of metabolic alkalosis because all of these etiologies will have similar findings (high bicarbonate and compensatory high carbon dioxide), especially in patient who has already received a venous blood gas.\n\nAnswer B: Complete blood count is useful for determining whether a patient is anemic resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to end organs due to decreased carrying capacity for oxygen. In cases of severe anemia and hypoperfusion, peripheral tissues produce lactic acid which will result in an anion gap metabolic acidosis rather than metabolic alkalosis.\n\nAnswer C: Serum glucose elevation can result in increased diuresis as well as pseudohyponatremia (decreased measured sodium due to increased glucose). Alternatively, acidosis may also be caused by insulin deficiency in diabetic ketoacidosis. Neither of these findings is consistent with the lab results seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Urine toxicology can be used to determine whether the patient is taking any substances of abuse.

Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication that improves survival in patients with ALS.\n\nALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neuron signs include spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron signs include muscle atrophy and fasciculations (spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation). In patients with bulbar-onset ALS, the initial clinical presentation is dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue atrophy, and abnormal jaw jerk reflex. Riluzole decreases the rate of glutamate release from presynaptic neurons, which is thought to decrease excitatory neurotoxicity. Riluzole improves survival by 2-6 months in patients with ALS and may have a greater survival benefit in patients with bulbar-onset ALS.\n\nMasori and Van Damme review the genetics, pathophysiology, classic clinical presentation, extra-motor manifestations, diagnostic workup, and treatment for ALS. They discuss how riluzole provides a survival benefit in patients with this disease. They recommend treating patients with ALS using riluzole as tolerated.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters to decrease spasticity in ALS. Along with tizanidine, baclofen is a first-line symptomatic treatment for spasticity in ALS. Baclofen does not improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer B: Dextromethorphan and quinidine is a combination of a sigma opioid receptor agonist and a sodium channel blocker used to control pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS. Pseudobulbar affect is a sudden uncontrollable outburst of laughter or tearfulness that affects almost half of patients with ALS. Dextromethorphan and quinidine has not been shown to improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer C: Edaravone is an intravenous antioxidant that may decrease the progression of early ALS. Although it is now FDA approved, studies have not yet shown that edaravone improves survival in patients with ALS. Further studies will be needed in order to determine the risks and benefits of using this drug.\n\nAnswer E: Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist that decreases spasticity in ALS by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons.

If the patient is between the ages of 40 and 50 and without other red flags, the patient can elect to undergo sigmoidoscopy as a less invasive procedure than colonoscopy. If the patient is under the age of 40 and without alarm symptoms, the workup may begin with an anoscopy to first evaluate for hemorrhoids. Once cancer has been ruled out, additional evaluation for chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis can be conducted.\n\nChurch presents evidence regarding the current use of colonoscopy. He discusses how the detection of neoplasia during colonoscopy is suboptimal despite its use as the current screening tool of choice. He recommends understanding which patients are missed and how to better detect neoplasias in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal CT might be used to evaluate for metastases if the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is confirmed but it would not be used to diagnose the primary malignancy. A CT scan would be the most appropriate initial step in diagnosis if diffuse metastasis were already suspected such as a presentation of severe weight loss and an enlarged, palpable, and nodular liver.\n\nAnswer B: Anoscopy is used for the evaluation of hemorrhoids in a patient < 40 years of age who presents with bright red blood per rectum in the absence of alarm symptoms. It would not be the most appropriate next step for a patient who presents with unexplained weight loss as it cannot be used to diagnose colorectal cancer.\n\nAnswer C: Barium enema is sometimes used to screen for colorectal cancer in conjunction with other tests in asymptomatic patients, but it would not be used to diagnose malignancy in a patient with alarm symptoms such as hematochezia and unexpected weight loss.\n\nAnswer E: Ultrasound of the abdomen would be effective in diagnosing conditions such as intraperitoneal bleeding and cholecystitis. There is no evidence of abdominal trauma that would suggest intraperitoneal bleeding in this patient. A positive ultrasound with free fluid would be treated with diagnostic laparoscopy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIf a patient is over the age of 50 or has alarm symptoms of weight loss, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or iron-deficiency anemia, the patient should undergo a colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer.", "realidx": 40, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 41-year-old man with rectal bleeding and weight loss, and it asks for the most appropriate next step in management.

{"question": "An 18-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with his parents for a sports physical. He was last seen in the clinic several months ago when he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He was started on methylphenidate at that time and the patient now reports improvement in his ability to concentrate in school and at home. He hopes to play baseball in college and has begun lifting weights daily in preparation for baseball season. The patient has a healthy diet to fuel his exercise regimen. His parents have no concerns and are pleased with the recent improvement in his grades. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/71 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical exam, the patient has tall stature with average muscle mass for his age. He has no dysmorphic features. His chest has a normal appearance other than mild gynecomastia. The patient has sparse facial hair and a moderate amount of coarse pubic hair that extends across the pubis and spares the medial thighs. His testes are small and firm.

Klinefelter syndrome is usually caused by meiotic nondisjunction that results in a 47,XXY genotype.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of primary hypogonadism. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome present with tall stature, neurocognitive difficulties (ADHD), and features of hypogonadism including gynecomastia, small testes, small phallus, hypospadias, underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics, and cryptorchidism. Patients without hypospadias or cryptorchidism are often not diagnosed until after puberty when the symptoms of gynecomastia and small testes become more prominent. Because the hypogonadism in Klinefelter syndrome is caused by testicular fibrosis, laboratory results demonstrate low testosterone and elevated FSH and LH levels. Treatment for this condition includes androgen replacement therapy.\n\nLanfranco et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of Klinefelter syndrome. They discuss how modern fertility augmentation therapy has allowed some of these patients to produce viable offspring. They recommend having a detailed discussion with these patients and their partners regarding possible outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anabolic steroid use causes decreased levels of FSH and LH due to the suppression of GnRH release by the hypothalamus. This results in decreased FSH and LH release by the pituitary gland. Anabolic steroid use would not present with signs of hypogonadism.\n\nAnswer B: The CGG trinucleotide repeat disorder characterizes fragile X syndrome. Fragile X presents with macroorchidism rather than hypogonadism and patients typically have dysmorphic features of a long, narrow face with large ears, a prominent forehead, and a prominent chin. Fragile X is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.\n\nAnswer C: The CTG trinucleotide repeat disorder characterizes myotonic dystrophy. Although myotonic dystrophy presents with hypogonadism, patients would also present with symptoms of progressive weakness, such as facial weakness, dysphagia, or hand grip weakness.

This can lead to hyperlipidemia (due to loss of lipoproteins), hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III and protein C/S), and hypoalbuminemia. Most serum calcium is bound to albumin, so when albumin is lost in the urine, it can lead to profound hypocalcemia. The ionized or free portion of calcium remains the same; therefore, these patients do not exhibit symptoms of hypocalcemia. Furthermore, the loss of albumin will reduce the oncotic pressure in the vessels resulting in massive extravasation of fluid and anasarca.\n\nAmbler et al. report a case of a patient who presented with a DVT and was found to have nephrotic syndrome. They discuss how the patient had asymptomatic changes in lab values including calcium. They recommend performing a urine dipstick for protein in cases of suspected nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antithrombin III deficiency is a common cause of a hypercoagulable state because antithrombin III normally helps to neutralize coagulation factors. This disease is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT as it predisposes patients to thrombotic events; however, it does not explain her profound hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic antithrombin III deficiency does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer B: Factor V Leiden is the most common cause of a hypercoagulable state because this mutation renders factor V unable to be inactivated by proteins C and S. This is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT; however, it does not explain her hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic factor V Leiden mutation does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer D: Liver dysfunction is possible given this patient's history of alcohol use and IV drug abuse, placing her at risk for chronic hepatitis C infection. Despite the anasarca, this patient has no other stigmata of liver failure such as jaundice or ascites, making nephrotic syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer E: Prothrombin gene mutation could explain this patient's hypercoagulable state because high levels of this gene can result in unprovoked thrombotic events.

The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding.

These myoclonic jerks usually have an onset occurring in early adolescence in otherwise healthy children. Myoclonic jerks are most frequently seen right after waking from sleep, but they may also be triggered by lack of sleep, stress, or alcohol consumption. Patients with this disease rarely have associated symptoms but may occasionally also experience absence seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The diagnosis can be secured with a history of seizures alongside an interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows 4 to 6 Hz bilateral polyspikes. Valproate is the first-line treatment.\n\nJohannessen et al. discuss the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. They find that standard antiepileptic treatment with agents such as valproate leads to only 33% of patients remaining seizure-free. They recommend trials of alternative antiepileptic medications such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and topiramate in patients that do not respond to valproate.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Absence seizures commonly present during childhood in otherwise healthy children; however, these seizures are typically characterized by short episodes of loss of awareness known as \"staring spells\" without physical manifestations.\n\nAnswer B: Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for precipitating juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, but alcohol use does not cause this condition. Seizure activity may also occur during alcohol withdrawal, but the timing of this patient's symptoms is more suggestive of seizure symptoms. Alcohol withdrawal requires chronic drinking of large amounts leading to an increase in central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a decrease in CNS gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.

The appropriate treatment for this is supportive care with return precautions (instructing the mother to bring the child back to a physician if he becomes short of breath).\n\nViral pharyngitis in children is most often caused by adenovirus, though other viruses can cause the condition as well. The diagnosis is clinical, with a presentation of fever, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, sore throat, and cough. Features that can help distinguish viral pharyngitis from pneumonia include a lack of tachypnea, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia, or adventitial lung sounds. No additional testing or intervention is necessary. The illness is typically self-limited and resolves with supportive care.\n\nShapiro et al. study features predictive of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children. The authors found that among patients with features of viral illness, patients older than 11 years of age who did not have a fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, or tonsillar exudates were at the lowest risk for GAS. The authors recommend against testing low-risk children for GAS to avoid antibiotic treatment in patients merely colonized with GAS.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering antitoxin and toxoid vaccine is the treatment for Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection. Although this child has not received his age-appropriate vaccinations, his presentation is not concerning for infection with diphtheria. C. diphtheriae infection presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and gray pseudomembranes on pharyngeal exam, neither of which this child has.\n\nAnswer B: Amoxicillin should be given in cases of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Before amoxicillin is prescribed, testing with Streptococcal rapid antigen detection testing should be performed. Additionally, rapid antigen detection testing is not indicated in this patient as she has a cough and does not have cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or palatal petechiae. All of these findings are not typical of GAS pharyngitis.\n\nAnswer C: Influenza testing and oseltamivir are indicated if the child had myalgias or high fevers that would make influenza more likely and if he presented within 2 days of symptom onset. Oseltamivir is only approved for treating influenza in uncomplicated cases if started within this 2-day window from symptom onset.

Given the bedside echocardiograph that is notable for a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing into a hyperkinetic left ventricle, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism that is causing obstructive shock.\n\nPulmonary embolism is most commonly caused by a deep vein thrombosis in the veins of the lower extremity that travels to the pulmonary circulation. Patients will present with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, sinus tachycardia, and hemoptysis. Massive pulmonary emboli can cause hemodynamic instability. Patients may become hypotensive, tachycardic, and ultimately pulseless. The pulmonary embolism can obstruct blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, leading to a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing and a hyperdynamic left ventricle. This is a type of obstructive shock. Treatment of a massive pulmonary embolism causing hemodynamic instability may involve thrombolytics or thrombectomy.\n\nStandl et al. review obstructive shock. They note that obstructive shock is caused by an obstruction of blood flow out of (or in the case of tamponade, into) the heart. They recommend that treating the underlying cause is the only effective management option.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiogenic shock is caused by cardiac dysfunction in conditions such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

Initial management includes treating the underlying cause (e.g., cardiac catheterization for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to maintain the patient\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nAnswer B: Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of shock in trauma and presents with hypotension and tachycardia secondary to blood loss. A narrowed pulse pressure may be the first sign of hemorrhagic shock. The mainstay of management is blood transfusion and an intervention to stop the bleeding.\n\nAnswer C: Neurogenic shock occurs when there is central nervous system trauma (often to the cervical spine) leading to decreased sympathetic tone systemically. Patients will present with hypotension and bradycardia (contrast with tachycardia in hemorrhagic shock), and management is centered on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and neurosurgical intervention for the underlying etiology. IV fluids can also be given to maintain blood pressure.\n\nAnswer E: Septic shock occurs when a systemic infection leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction with hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation.

{"question": "An 8-week-old boy presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. She reports that about 2 weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. He seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. His mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient\u2019s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively.

Huntington disease is characterized by atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is a structure of the dorsal striatum.\n\nHuntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorder located on chromosome 4. HD typically presents with mood changes and abnormal movements (particularly chorea or myoclonus) over weeks to months.

Frontotemporal dementia, in contrast, usually presents with behavioral changes, and Alzheimer disease has memory impairment as an early sign.

The first step in the resuscitation of patients with variceal hemorrhage is rapid administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and octreotide.\n\nEsophageal and gastric varices, most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, are abnormally distended veins that are a product of venous congestion from portal hypertension. As these varices can project into the gastrointestinal lumen, they are subject to rupture either spontaneously or by mechanical disruption (e.g., tearing by food particles). Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis as it can quickly progress to hemorrhagic shock or airway loss (if profuse vomiting is present). Patients should immediately receive 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (or central IV access) with which to administer IV fluid boluses to increase circulating volume. Blood should be transfused as needed, and a massive transfusion protocol may be needed. Patients should also be given octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, in an effort to divert blood away from the hemorrhaging varices. Other treatments that should be given include ceftriaxone (to reduce bacteremia and mortality), proton pump inhibitors, and possibly interventions such as tranexamic acid. Upper GI endoscopy and banding are the definitive therapy.\n\nStanley et al review the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding with initial IV fluid resuscitation as the first measure to achieve hemodynamic stability. They also report that for patients with cirrhosis, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide should be started as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Red blood cell transfusion is indicated at a hemoglobin transfusion of 7.0-8.0 g/dL. Definitive therapy is endoscopy with variceal ligation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon tamponade is often performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit as a temporizing measure to achieve hemostasis for patients with severe and persistent variceal hemorrhage. The balloon is inserted into the esophagus or stomach and inflated to apply direct pressure to the bleeding varices; this buys valuable time in the transition to definitive endoscopic management.\n\nAnswer B: Ceftriaxone is administered to patients with cirrhosis who present with an upper gastrointestinal bleed as a prophylactic measure against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and antibiotics should not delay initial intravenous fluid resuscitation as well as other measures to reduce and/or stop the bleeding. While this patient should receive ceftriaxone, it is more dire to first give fluids, blood, and octreotide.\n\nAnswer C: Nadolol or other nonselective beta-blocker therapy is indicated as secondary prophylaxis to prevent future bleeding episodes for patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage. Non-selective beta blockers such as nadolol decrease portal pressure, but are contraindicated in the acute setting as they could exacerbate hypovolemic shock by reducing cardiac output.\n\nAnswer D: Platelet transfusion is required for patients with variceal hemorrhage with an initial platelet count < 50,000/mm^3, and for those who receive a significant amount of blood products during their resuscitation (significant dilutional thrombocytopenia can occur after 10-12 units of transfused red blood cells). This patient's platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3, and he has not yet received blood products.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of a cirrhosis patient with acute variceal hemorrhage is the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor.", "realidx": 58, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 52-year-old man with hematemesis and a history of alcohol use disorder.

Patients are often critically ill and require active rewarming and close monitoring in an ICU setting.\n\nWall reviews myxedema coma. Wall notes that myxedema coma is a life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism. She recommends that generally IV T4 (levothyroxine) is preferred over IV T3 in initial management.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering glucagon would be appropriate in a beta-blocker overdose, which presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. There is no indication that this patient intentionally overdosed, and her hyponatremia and thinning hair supports a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Other treatments that can be given in a beta-blocker overdose including epinephrine, calcium, insulin, dextrose, and lipid emulsion therapy.\n\nAnswer C: Obtaining blood cultures and a serum lactate is the appropriate management of sepsis/septic shock. Generally, patients with septic shock present with hypotension (refractory to fluid resuscitation), tachycardia, and fever or hypothermia. Though myocardial depression may happen in critically ill patients who are about to undergo cardiac arrest, hypothyroidism better explains this patient's constellation of symptoms. It would be appropriate to obtain cultures and a serum lactate in this patient while the differential is being narrowed.\n\nAnswer D: Performing a CT scan of the head would be indicated at some point in the workup of patients with altered mental status if there was a suspected central nervous system etiology such as a subdural hematoma. However, hemodynamically unstable patients should never be sent to the CT scanner prior to stabilization and resuscitation. A subdural hematoma is more common in older patients and patients with alcohol use disorder who experience head trauma as the atrophy of their brain makes the bridging veins more vulnerable.\n\nAnswer E: Performing an echocardiogram may show reduced cardiac function; however, it is unlikely to reveal the underlying cause of this patient's hypotension and bradycardia other than showing poor cardiac function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMyxedema coma presents as a critically ill, obtunded patient who is hypothermic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, and the diagnosis can be supported with a high TSH and a low free T4.", "realidx": 61, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 67-year-old woman with altered mental status.

Cervical spondylosis is a common cause of cervical radiculopathy in elderly patients with chronic neck pain, especially in patients with findings suggestive of degenerative joint diseases (history of lumbar fusion and hip arthroplasty).\n\nCervical spondylosis is caused by degeneration of the intervertebral disc with possible disc herniation and facet joints with osteophyte formation. These osteophytes and cervical disc herniation can cause compression of exiting nerve roots, leading to radiculopathy. Radicular symptoms depend on the nerve root affected. For example, C6 radiculopathy causes weakness in wrist extension and a decreased brachioradialis reflex while C7 radiculopathy causes weakness in elbow extension and wrist flexion with a decreased triceps reflex. Sensory symptoms may be present depending on the dermatome affected. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI. Treatment consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and/or corticosteroids for pain.

ALS presents with hyperreflexia (as opposed to hyporeflexia), spasticity, weakness, and fasciculations. Treatment includes riluzole (to improve survival) and symptomatic management.\n\nAnswer B: Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel at the wrist. While the thenar eminence is typically spared due to take-off of the palmar cutaneous branch proximal to the carpal tunnel, the thumb and index finger are also affected. This patient\u2019s symptoms primarily involve the middle finger, which is more indicative of a radiculopathy. Treatment is activity modification, splinting, and ultimately, surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel if refractory.\n\nAnswer D: Syringomyelia is caused by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord that leads to central cord syndrome, characterized by weakness that is greater in the upper extremities compared to lower extremities and loss of pain and temperature sensation in a cape-like distribution in the upper back and upper extremities. This patient\u2019s sensory loss is unilateral and in a dermatomal distribution. Treatment of syringomyelia can include surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer E: Transverse myelitis is characterized by segmental inflammation of the spinal cord that would present with acute, bilateral flaccid paresis based on the level affected and sensory loss within a sensory level.

Patients may present initially with symptoms including confusion, repeat questioning, repeating themselves, and amnesia surrounding the event. A thorough neurological exam is important as there should be no neurologic deficits in a concussion. Patients with a classic history and reassuring exam require rest from physical and cognitive activity. Post-concussive syndrome may present with chronic headaches, dizziness, trouble sleeping, trouble focusing, nausea, and difficulties with learning and concentrating. Mood changes such as depression and anxiety are common.

While a severe concussion and a cerebral contusion have overlap, given this patient\u2019s age, mechanism, and symptoms, concussion is more likely. A head CT would demonstrate contusion (hyperdense intraparenchymal lesion) with a possible contrecoup injury.\n\nAnswer C: Diffuse axonal injury occurs after a severe CNS injury with an obtunded patient who is typically unresponsive.

Patients typically present with painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and often there is no mass palpable on breast exam. Ultrasound is the initial method for evaluation and may reveal an intraductal mass, but if results are inconclusive, further imaging with mammography is indicated. If the results of both still remain inconclusive, galactography (radiography after injecting radiopaque contrast into the duct system) is the most accurate imaging method for diagnosing intraductal papilloma. A core biopsy of the intraductal mass should be obtained, and if results show papilloma with atypia, treatment would be surgical excision of the involved duct to rule out a concomitant malignant neoplasm.\n\nKhan et al. review the treatment of intraductal papilloma and note that in lesions with core biopsy showing papilloma with atypia, surgical excision revealed the diagnosis of a concomitant invasive or ductal in situ cancer is common. The authors also find that in patients whose core biopsies showed papilloma without atypia, the likelihood of cancer was much lower. The authors recommend that since the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma carries an increased risk of breast cancer compared to the general population, these patients should be monitored accordingly.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a neoplastic lesion confined to the breast duct that if untreated develops into invasive ductal carcinoma. Typically, patients are asymptomatic, and lesions are detected via screening mammography. Though it can sometimes present with nipple discharge, this is less common. Unilateral painless bloody nipple discharge is more likely to be due to intraductal papilloma, though no mass may be palpable for either diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, which typically presents as a firm, immobile, painless lump in the breast, sometimes associated with nipple discharge, overlying skin changes, inverted nipple, and/or axillary lymphadenopathy. As with DCIS, nipple discharge may be present but is usually not bloody as in cases of intraductal papilloma.\n\nAnswer D: Mammary duct ectasia is a benign condition in which a milk duct in the breast widens and its walls thicken, leading to blockage and build-up of fluid in the duct. This is usually asymptomatic but can present with off-white or greenish nipple discharge. It may also result in infection of the affected duct, leading to periductal mastitis and a tender, erythematous breast. It tends to occur in perimenopausal women and often resolves without treatment, though if symptoms persist it can be treated with antibiotics and duct excision.\n\nAnswer E: Paget disease of the breast often presents as a scaly, raw, vesicular, or ulcerated lesion that begins on the nipple and then spreads to the areola, sometimes associated with bloody nipple discharge. Pain, burning, and pruritis are also common presenting symptoms. There is often an underlying breast carcinoma; thus, any patient with Paget disease should be evaluated with a mammogram. Although this patient has bloody nipple discharge, she does not present with a painful, scaly, raw, or vesiculated lesion that would be concerning for Paget disease of the breast.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIntraductal papilloma often manifests in patients as painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and typically no mass is palpable on exam.", "realidx": 69, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 34-year-old woman with specific symptoms and examination findings related to her breast.

{"question": "A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband with a 1 hour history of an unremitting headache. The headache started suddenly while she was eating dinner and she says it feels like the \u201cworst headache of my life.\u201d An emergent CT scan of the head without contrast confirms the diagnosis, and a CT angiogram identifies the source of bleeding. The patient undergoes surgical management of her condition. On hospital day 3, she is found to be disoriented to person, place, and time. She also develops nausea and vomiting. Her medical problems consist of heart failure for which she takes furosemide, spironolactone, and metoprolol, which were continued at admission. Her temperature is 99.6\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows poor skin turgor.

Urine sodium is 44 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Cerebral salt wasting", "options": {"A": "Addison disease", "B": "Cerebral salt wasting", "C": "Diuretic overuse", "D": "Primary polydipsia", "E": "Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This patient presents with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (\u201cworst headache of my life\u201d) which is treated and then subsequently develops nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status with reduced serum sodium concentration, indicative of symptomatic hyponatremia. In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia.

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed.

The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates.

Normally, bladder contraction occurs due to the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle. Urinary urge incontinence is due to detrusor overactivity, leading to a sudden and frequently overwhelming need to void that occurs throughout the day and night. The most common cause is idiopathic, though it may be secondary to neurologic disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis), bladder abnormalities, or chronic bladder inflammation. Workup is first centered on ruling out a urinary tract infection with a urinalysis. The diagnosis is made with urodynamic studies, and first-line treatment involves bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Should first-line treatment of urge incontinence fail, antimuscarinic medications (such as oxybutynin) which reduce acetylcholine activity on muscarinic receptors can decrease detrusor contraction and thus the sense of urgency.\n\nNandy and Ranganathan review urge incontinence.

This is best treated with propranolol.\n\nBenign essential tremor is a type of rhythmic oscillatory movement that occurs with posturing and action. The pathophysiology of this disorder is unclear; however, it classically gets worse with actions that require terminal positioning of the extremities such as pouring a drink or pointing a television remote. The tremor improves with alcohol consumption so patients will often self-medicate with alcoholic drinks. There is a strong genetic component, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. The best method of replicating the tremor is with the finger-nose-finger test because this requires the patient to perform a precise activity at a terminal distance. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment is with propranolol or primidone, which are both considered first-line agents although the latter has less evidence for its efficacy.\n\nPaparella et al. studied the effects of propranolol on head and upper extremity movements in patients with benign essential tremors. They found that this medication has no effect on head movements but reduces the number of upper extremity tremors in these patients. They recommended that agents other than propranolol should be used for the treatment of head tremors in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alcoholics anonymous is the first-line treatment for patients with alcohol use disorder; however, the tremors that occur during alcohol withdrawal are not isolated to movements during terminal activities. Alcohol withdrawal also presents with other signs including restlessness, diaphoresis, and insomnia. More severe cases can present with hallucinations and seizures. The response of this patient's tremor to alcohol consumption is typical of patients with benign essential tremor.\n\nAnswer B: Aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotic medications can be used in patients with Tourette syndrome; however, these patients will present with involuntary tics rather than a tremor that only occurs during a voluntary activity at the terminal range of motion. Moreover, for the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, both motor and phonic tics must be present.\n\nAnswer C: Carbidopa can be used in the treatment of Parkinson disease; however, the tremor associated with this disease classically occurs at rest and is described in character as a \"pill-rolling\" tremor.

It is thought to be due to a bacterial overgrowth/infection that then damages the intestinal mucosa. Endemic areas include the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and South India. Patients present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/cramps, progressive weight loss, and clinical features of malabsorption. Patients with tropical sprue can develop megaloblastic anemia (low hemoglobin and elevated MCV) from a deficiency in folate and vitamin B12 absorption.

The development of symptoms following significant travel (lasting at least several weeks) to an endemic country should raise suspicion for tropical sprue.\n\nAnswer B: Crohn disease presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, skip lesions anywhere from mouth to anus, extraintestinal manifestations, and signs of malabsorption. A biopsy will show transmural inflammation with noncaseating granulomas, giant cells, and aggregates of lymphocytes in the lamina propria.\n\nAnswer C: Giardia is a parasite that is endemic in the tropics and North American mountain regions. Patients present with foul-smelling diarrhea, excessive gas, and nausea. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a stool analysis or immunoassay. Though a biopsy is normally not indicated, it would show mild lymphocytic infiltration and Giardia trophozoites on the intestinal surface.\n\nAnswer E: Whipple disease is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei. Patients present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and signs of malabsorption. Extraintestinal symptoms such as arthritis are common.

{"question": "A 33-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with muscle spasms. She has noticed \"twitching\" in both her upper and lower extremities over the past 3 days that have interfered with her training for a marathon. She has felt more fatigued over the past month. She has no significant medical history. She takes no medication other than whey protein supplements, a multivitamin, and fish oil. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 103/71 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam reveals a thin woman with thinning hair. She appears pale and her mucous membranes are dry. Her neurological and cardiac exams are unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below. Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL Hematocrit: 30% Leukocyte count: 6,100/mm^3 with normal differential Platelet count: 187,500/mm^3 Serum: Na+: 130 mEq/L Cl-: 100 mEq/L K+: 2.3 mEq/L HCO3-: 28 mEq/L BUN: 40 mg/dL Glucose: 79 mg/dL Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL Ca2+: 8.2 mg/dL Mg2+: 1.8 mg/dL Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): 4.0 mIU/L Free T4: 0.4 ng/dL (normal: 0.7-1.53 ng/dL) The patient is given 4 liters of lactated ringer solution and 40 mEq of potassium. Her repeat whole blood potassium 3 hours later is 2.4 mEq/L, and her repeat BUN is 20 mEq/L. Another 40 mEq of potassium is administered. Another repeat whole blood potassium is 2.5 mEq/L. The patient\u2019s muscle spasms persist. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology for this patient\u2019s chief concern?", "answer": "Hypomagnesemia", "options": {"A": "Hypocalcemia", "B": "Hypomagnesemia", "C": "Hyponatremia", "D": "Hypothyroidism", "E": "Hypovolemia"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This patient is presenting with what appears to be anorexia nervosa (thin habitus, possible excessive exercise in the setting of marathon running, thinning hair, dry mucous membranes, decreased free T4 level, and multiple electrolyte derangements). The lack of improvement in either her muscle spasms with fluid repletion or her hypokalemia with adequate repletion, even in the setting of normal serum magnesium, suggests depleted magnesium stores are the underlying etiology of her symptoms.\n\nHypomagnesemia typically occurs in alcoholics, malnourished patients, and patients with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Patients may present with a wide array of symptoms including weakness, confusion, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and overall malaise. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone secretion. Another pathognomonic finding associated with hypomagnesemia is hypokalemia which is refractory to repletion. The pathophysiology is thought to be due to increased potassium wasting in the kidney due to increased activity of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels. The serum magnesium level should be checked and repletion should occur accordingly. Serum magnesium levels represent 1% or less of total body magnesium stores and do not reflect if a patient truly has hypomagnesemia, particularly if there is intracellular depletion (such as in chronically malnourished patients). Thus, any patient with findings consistent with hypomagnesemia with normal serum magnesium should have their other electrolytes repleted and be given magnesium. Magnesium repletion is a safe intervention with a wide therapeutic index, and the serum level often does not correlate with total body stores.\n\nRazzaque discusses the relationship between serum magnesium levels and total body magnesium status. The author finds that inadequate magnesium balance is associated with myriad disorders including skeletal deformities, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. The author recommends the use of the magnesium loading test to provide more accurate reflections of total body magnesium status.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hypocalcemia may present with perioral numbness, paresthesias, and muscle spasms. It can occur secondary to poor nutrition, vitamin D deficiency, and hypoparathyroidism. Low serum calcium may also be seen in patients with low albumin and in states of hyperventilation (which lowers the free calcium but not the total calcium due to a respiratory alkalosis that causes albumin to bind free calcium and release protons). Hypomagnesemia can also cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone release.\n\nAnswer C: Hyponatremia may present with malaise, nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion. Patients may also be asymptomatic in mild cases. Asymptomatic patients with hyponatremia and functioning kidneys require only fluid restriction. On the other hand, severe hyponatremia presents with very low sodium (often < 120 mEq/L) and neurological symptoms such as profound confusion or seizures. Treatment with hypertonic saline would be indicated in this situation.\n\nAnswer D: Hypothyroidism presents with fatigue, malaise, weight gain, bradycardia, scarce lanugo, and depression. This patient\u2019s TSH is on the high end of normal and her T4 is lower than the cutoff value. However, this is likely a compensatory response to her low BMI and excessive exercise in order to slow down her metabolism to conserve energy.\n\nAnswer E: Hypovolemia was certainly present in this patient given her dry mucous membranes and prerenal pattern of labs (BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1). After receiving 4L of fluids, it is clear that dehydration is not the cause of her symptoms as her BUN corrects and her symptoms persist. In general, hypovolemia should be treated with oral rehydration, if possible.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia and hypokalemia refractory to repletion (a normal serum level does not indicate normal intracellular levels of magnesium).", "realidx": 83, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, medical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

Affected women often develop these symptoms in their 30s or 40s, though they may occur at any age, and many are asymptomatic. Risk factors include early menarche, obesity, family history, and African American race. Submucosal fibroids that disrupt the endometrium may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Intramural fibroids also commonly cause heavy bleeding despite the fact that they do not disrupt the endometrium due to alterations in the uterine vasculature.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days.

Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.", "realidx": 98, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a newborn with a specific condition characterized by diffuse swelling of the scalp.

{"question": "A 4-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last 2 days. Her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and was discharged home after 2 days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a confirmatory test of cure. The biological father is no longer involved in the patient's life, but her mother\u2019s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. The neonate\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 56/35 mmHg, pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin.

Although having an unrelated adult as a caregiver is traditionally a risk factor, there is no evidence that this neonate is being abused. Risk factors include vaginal trauma and bruising.\n\nAnswer C: Vaginal culture may be indicated if an infectious etiology such as chlamydia or group A streptococcus is suspected; however, this would more commonly present with bloody and mucopurulent discharge with or without surrounding skin inflammation. Furthermore, the patient\u2019s mother was successfully treated for chlamydia during pregnancy, making chlamydial infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer D: Vaginal exam under anesthesia would be appropriate if a foreign body or trauma is suspected because prepubescent children should not undergo exams while awake. In a neonate with physiologic discharge, an exam is unnecessary. Foreign bodies would present with bloody discharge, pain, and potential purulence.\n\nAnswer E: Warm water irrigation of the vagina may be helpful in locating a foreign body, which is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding and discharge in a prepubertal girl.

His medical history is significant for hypertension but he does not take any medications. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, and respirations are 12/min on a ventilator. His Glasgow coma score (GCS) on presentation is 6.

Cortical and brain stem function must be absent in brain death; however, spinal cord reflexes such as triple flexion (flexion of the thigh, leg, and foot upon noxious stimulation of the foot) may remain intact in patients with brain death.\n\nThe clinical brain death exam may be performed in patients with evidence of irreversible central nervous system catastrophe after a known mechanism of trauma or medical injury. The patient must not have other causes for obtundation, and should be euthermic, not on sedative or paralytic agents, not be intoxicated due to drugs or poisoning, and not have other severe electrolyte, acid-base, or endocrine disturbances. In brain death, there must be no cerebral motor response such as moaning or grimacing to pain in all extremities and the face. Brain stem reflexes such as the pupillary light reflex, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, vestibulo-ocular reflex, gag reflex, and apnea test should also be absent in brain death. Spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may still be present in brain death. Complex movements mediated by the spinal cord such as triple flexion and the Lazarus sign (raising the arms and dropping them crossed on the chest after noxious stimulus) do not preclude a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nGreer et al. review neurologic criteria for the determination of brain death. They discuss how to clinically differentiate spinal motor responses from brain-mediated motor responses. They recommend understanding these distinctions in order to properly examine patients with brain death.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blinking after saline is applied to the cornea indicates a positive corneal reflex. In the corneal reflex, the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal (V1) nerve senses stimulus to the cornea, and bilateral temporal branches of the facial nerve (VII) activate the orbicularis oculi muscles to blink. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of a corneal reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer B: Conjugate eye movement to the left with rotation of the head to the right describes the oculocephalic reflex. In this reflex, movement of the head stimulates endolymph in the horizontal semicircular canal to rotate, causing the firing of the ipsilateral vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerve. This leads to activation or inhibition of the contralateral abducens (VI) and oculomotor (III) nerves. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of an oculocephalic reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer D: Grimacing after the noxious stimulus of the arm indicates some residual cortical function. Grimacing is not a spinal cord reflex and requires some cortical processing of sensory information. All cortical function must be absent in brain death, so grimacing to pain would not be compatible with brain death.\n\nAnswer E: Spontaneous respiration 1 minute after disconnection from a ventilator in a patient without diabetes insipidus and with normal blood gas values and systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg indicates a negative apnea test. The apnea test assesses respiratory control system reflexes in the brainstem. Apnea testing is an important component of the brain death exam, and a negative apnea test is incompatible with brain death.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAlthough brain death criteria universally include the absence of cortical and brainstem function, spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may be preserved in patients with brain death.", "realidx": 102, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a patient who has been in a motor vehicle accident and is now being evaluated for brain death.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with epistaxis for the past hour.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?", "answer": "Topical oxymetazoline", "options": {"A": "Cauterization with silver nitrate", "B": "Fresh frozen plasma and intravenous phytonadione", "C": "Intravenous tranexamic acid", "D": "Placement of posterior nasal packing", "E": "Topical oxymetazoline"}, "answer_idx": "E", "reason": "This patient on warfarin is presenting with epistaxis from the anterior nares (and is currently hemodynamically stable) suggesting anterior epistaxis. Prior to more invasive measures, topical therapy with oxymetazoline should be tried as it is very successful in reducing or resolving epistaxis.\n\nEpistaxis can be a benign or life-threatening presentation. For anterior epistaxis, the management is centered on compression of the anterior nares as most cases are caused by bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus. If this fails, the next step in management is having the patient blow their nose to remove any clots, followed by vigorous application of topical oxymetazoline which vasoconstricts the vessels in the nares and is highly effective in treating epistaxis. If this fails, other topical agents include topical tranexamic acid, and thrombogenic foams. If pressure and topical therapy fail to resolve epistaxis, then anterior nasal packing (such as nasal tampons) may be used.\n\nKucik and Clenney review treatments for epistaxis. They note that the first-line treatment of anterior epistaxis is compression of the anterior nares. If this fails, they recommend other measures such as topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, and packing.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cauterization with silver nitrate is appropriate for anterior epistaxis, but generally should be reserved for patients who have failed initial medical therapy with topical agents. It may also be appropriate first-line therapy in patients with recurrent epistaxis from a clear, single bleeding vessel (which is not present in this patient).\n\nAnswer B: Fresh frozen plasma and intravenous phytonadione is the appropriate reversal agent for warfarin. While this may stop the patient's epistaxis, he is hemodynamically stable and the bleeding is not life-threatening; thus, the risk of thrombus from atrial fibrillation is likely greater than the risk of bleeding in this case of epistaxis. Less invasive medical therapy should be started/tried first.\n\nAnswer C: Intravenous tranexamic acid would be appropriate in an acutely hemorrhaging patient to reduce bleeding in the setting of hemorrhagic shock. Topical (not intravenous) tranexamic acid may be an appropriate first-line agent for anterior epistaxis.\n\nAnswer D: Placement of posterior nasal packing would be indicated if there was persistent bleeding in the setting of posterior epistaxis (often from bleeding from the sphenopalatine artery), which presents with more profuse bleeding that may threaten the airway. This patient's bleeding is clearly anterior as it can easily be visualized in the anterior nares; thus, this intervention is not needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTopical oxymetazoline and other topical agents such as tranexamic acid are appropriate first-line agents in the management of epistaxis if pressure alone fails to resolve symptoms.", "realidx": 103, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a patient with epistaxis and provides a detailed description of the patient's medical history, current medications, vital signs, and physical examination findings.

It has multiple etiologies, including disc herniation, epidural abscess, tumor, or lumbar spine spondylosis. Cauda equina syndrome presents with severe low back pain radiating into the legs, flaccid paralysis or lower extremity weakness which can be symmetric or asymmetric (often asymmetric), bladder and/or rectal sphincter paralysis, impotence/erectile dysfunction, sensory loss in affected dermatomes, and saddle anesthesia (sensory loss in the perineum). Urinary retention occurs due to bladder paralysis. Diagnosis is aided by emergency magnetic resonance imaging. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency; the goal of surgical treatment is to decompress the cauda equina to prevent permanent neurological injury, such as with a lumbar laminectomy. This can be differentiated from conus medullaris syndrome, which has perianal numbness without numbness through other dermatomes (down the leg in the S1 or S2 patterns), less severe pain (cauda equina presents with more severe pain), and hyperreflexia in the knees (cauda equina presents with lower motor neuron signs in the legs which lead to decreased reflexes - though conus medullaris may present with absent ankle reflexes, the knees are typically hyperreflexic).\n\nGardner et al. review the symptoms, diagnosis, and medico-legal landscape of cauda equina syndrome. They discuss how the most frequent etiology is a large central lumbar disc herniation. They recommend being vigilant for urinary retention in patients who may have compression as many patients have urinary retention on presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, also known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, occurs after respiratory or gastrointestinal infections and presents with ascending paralysis and diminished reflexes. While bladder dysfunction can occur, back pain is not typical. Guillain-Barre syndrome can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\nAnswer C: L5/S1 disc herniation affects the traversing S1 nerve root. S1 radiculopathy presents with posterolateral leg and dorsolateral foot sensory loss and absence of the ankle reflex. Typically, bowel/bladder symptoms are not present. Treatment includes decompression of the affected nerve root.\n\nAnswer D: Overflow incontinence is caused by either bladder outlet obstruction or poor bladder tone. While this could explain this patient\u2019s urinary retention, it does not account for his back pain or sensorimotor deficits. Isolated overflow incontinence can be treated with catheterization.\n\nAnswer E: Spinal stenosis presents with lower extremity claudication, characterized by pain with standing or ambulation. The pain of neurogenic claudication is characteristically relieved by spinal flexion (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d).

The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues.

The patient should have a radiograph of the hand and wrist to evaluate for discrepancies between bone age and chronological age.\n\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics (increased testicular volume and pubic hair) at 14 years or older. It has a variety of etiologies including chromosomal abnormalities, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiencies, and constitutional delay of puberty. In addition to obtaining a history and physical examination, initial diagnostic studies used to work up delayed puberty includes a radiograph of the hand and wrist to determine bone age, and serum studies (complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, follicular-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], and testosterone). Radiography can compare the patient's bone age to the chronological age (as constitutional delay presents with delayed bone age), and serum endocrine studies can help distinguish between primary causes of hypogonadism (high FSH and LH) and secondary causes of hypogonadism (low to normal FSH and LH). Treatment in cases with a specific cause of delayed puberty is aimed at the underlying cause. For male patients with presumed constitutional delay of puberty, therapy can include hormone replacement with testosterone.\n\nSaengkaew et al. discuss the genetics of pubertal delay. The authors find that pathologic mechanisms that may underlie constitutional delay of puberty are largely related to GnRH neuronal development and biology.

These symptoms would suggest that the patient has a prolactinoma causing impingement of the optic chiasm leading to bitemporal hemianopsia and sometimes a headache. Laboratory studies consistent with a prolactinoma include elevated serum prolactin with low to normal FSH and TSH.\n\nAnswer C: Reassurance with close follow-up would be appropriate in some patients with constitutional delay of puberty, which is the most common cause of delayed puberty. It is believed to be caused by a transient defect in the production of GnRH. Patients typically have a family history of \"late bloomers,\" characterized as family members having a late growth spurt or late puberty.\n\nAnswer E: Testicular ultrasound would be appropriate in patients with asymmetric testicles since gonadal tumors can occur in a number of intersex disorders (e.g., androgen insensitivity syndrome) and present with impaired sexual maturation.\n\nBuller Summary:\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as a lack of testicular enlargement by age 14 and initial diagnostic evaluation should include radiography of the hand and wrist as well as serum testing (FSH, LH, and testosterone).", "realidx": 117, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 16-year-old boy with concerns about delayed puberty and short stature.

Poor glycemic control increases the risk of a neural tube defect in the fetus.\n\nInfants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at increased risk of many congenital malformations as well as postnatal complications. These risks are more likely if there is poor maternal glycemic control, especially in the periconceptional period. Poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c and microalbuminuria on urinalysis indicate long-standing poor glycemic control and indicate a poor prognosis. The most common anomalies in IDM are cardiovascular defects such as septal defects and transposition of the great arteries as well as neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Sacral agenesis, or a poorly developed caudal spine and spinal cord, as well as small left colon syndrome due to a meconium plug, are other common malformations seen in IDM. General complications in IDM include prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia, and miscarriage. Risk is minimized by tight glycemic control throughout pregnancy.\n\nDean et al. summarize the evidence surrounding micronutrients and obesity in pregnancy. They found that patients with diabetes had a higher risk of having infants with a neural tube or a congenital heart defect. They recommend using folic acid supplementation in all patients to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aneuoploidy risk is not increased in IDM. This complication is associated with advanced maternal age. This patient is at baseline risk since she is below the \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d cutoff of 35 years. Some of the values used in aneuploidy screening (maternal serum alpha\u00adfetoprotein, estriol, and inhibin A) are generally lower in women with diabetes. Guidelines specific to this patient population should be used for the aneuploidy screen so as to avoid false positive results.\n\nAnswer B: Neonatal hyperglycemia is not seen in IDM. Patients may experience hypoglycemia. This is due to the crossing of glucose from the mother to the fetus via the placenta and subsequent hyperinsulinemia and \u00df-cell hyperplasia from the fetus. After delivery, the high insulin levels cause hypoglycemia because there is no longer an overabundant source of glucose. Hyperglycemia in infants is much less common and can be due to glucose infusion or sepsis.\n\nAnswer D: Oligohydramnios is not specifically associated with maternal hyperglycemia. Instead, patients may experience polyhydramnios. The mechanism for increased amniotic fluid is unclear, though some speculate that fetal hyperglycemia results in polyuria and thus polyhydramnios. Severe oligohydramnios can cause pulmonary hypoplasia and clubfoot as well as cord compression, while polyhydramnios is associated with cord prolapse, placental abruption, and prematurity.\n\nAnswer E: Post-term delivery occurs after 42 weeks gestation. Maternal diabetes typically causes prematurity. Post-term delivery is associated with fetal malnutrition, hypoxemia, and oligohydramnios due to suboptimal functioning of the placenta. The risk of meconium aspiration increases as gestational age increases.

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin.

Compression of the nerve leads to symptoms along the plantar surface of the foot which can include pain, tingling, or numbness. These symptoms can be exacerbated/triggered by tapping on the tunnel, which lies posterior to the medial malleolus. In addition, the symptoms can occur at rest or during activity and are not improved with rest. Treatment is rest, NSAIDs, properly fitted shoes/orthotics, and in refractory cases, surgical release of the tarsal tunnel.\n\nGould reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of tarsal tunnel syndrome. He discusses how this syndrome represents a collection of different entities including space-filling lesions and local inflammation. He recommends definitive diagnosis prior to surgical treatment given that the syndrome is often misdiagnosed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Common fibular nerve compression typically occurs when there is trauma/compression just inferior to the head of the fibula. This can occur when an individual wears work boots and after fractures of the fibular neck. Symptoms of common fibular nerve compression include foot drop and numbness on the dorsum of the foot. Treatment is with activity modification and a foot orthosis to prevent an equinus contracture.\n\nAnswer B: Herniated disc presents with symptoms of radiculopathy including pain that travels down the leg through the toes. Symptoms are worsened with flexion of the leg such as during the straight leg raise test. Treatment is with NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections with surgical decompression of the disc in refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Plantar fasciitis can present very similarly to tarsal tunnel syndrome with pain along the plantar surface of the foot. The pain is typically exacerbated by activity and improves with rest in contrast to this patient. In addition, there is an absence of burning, pain, and numbness that occur in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Tenderness will be at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneal tuberosity. Treatment is conservative with NSAIDs and activity modification.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B12 deficiency could present with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. This is possible given this patient's vegan diet. This patient has pain only in one of his feet and he does not have symptoms of anemia such as fatigue or pallor.

Patients with penetrating wounds and hard signs of vascular injury should be managed with emergent surgical intervention.\n\nVascular injury commonly occurs as a result of penetrating trauma, such as a stab wound as in this patient. Evaluation begins with a primary and secondary trauma survey to assess for other injuries. Hard signs of vascular injury include pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, and absent pulses distal to the wound. For patients with suspected vascular injury that display either hard signs or hemodynamic instability, emergent surgical intervention is the most appropriate next step in management. For those with soft signs of vascular injury such as non-pulsatile bleeding or associated bony injury, the most appropriate next step in management is CT angiography of the affected limb.\n\nBall et al. discuss penetrating trauma to the extremities. They state that extremity trauma is the most common source of vascular injury (51%), with femoral artery as the most frequently injured vessel (35%).

The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation.

The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles.

Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome).

Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance. The earliest radiographic sign is the erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease. MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

These steroids adversely impair endogenous testicular function, causing infertility secondary to decreased testicular size and sperm count. Furthermore, hepatic dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction can occur at high doses. Excess testosterone is converted to estradiol, leading to breast enlargement and signs of gynecomastia.

{"question": "A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with hip and back pain. He states this weekend he had a barbecue. When he was lifting a heavy object, he suddenly felt pain in his lower back. He describes the pain as in his buttocks but states that at times it travels down his leg. He states that it feels electrical and burning in nature. The patient has a medical history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and a surgical repair of his anterior cruciate ligament. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and sodium docusate. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 131/82 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, he is found to have an intact motor and sensory function in his lower extremities bilaterally. No clonus or Babinski sign is appreciated. An exam of the cranial nerves is intact bilaterally. Which of the following is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis?", "answer": "Straight leg raise", "options": {"A": "Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh", "B": "Internal rotation of the extended hip", "C": "Palpating the paraspinal muscles", "D": "Radiography", "E": "Straight leg raise"}, "answer_idx": "E", "reason": "This patient is presenting with lower back pain that is electrical and travels down his legs after lifting an object suggesting a diagnosis of a herniated disc. The straight leg test can help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA herniated disc classically presents in a middle-aged or older individual who was lifting a heavy object with improper form. They will typically experience lower back pain that can be described as radicular. The pain will typically travel down the legs or \"shoot down\" the legs and is typically described as feeling electrical. The straight leg test on physical exam supports the diagnosis without an MRI. When the individual raises their leg, this causes compression of the spinal nerve roots leading to an exacerbation of symptoms. The most appropriate initial step in management for these patients is limiting strenuous activity, physical therapy, and NSAIDs. Patients who have chronic symptoms that have failed conservative management can undergo surgical laminectomy.\n\nCamino and Piuzzi present the data regarding the diagnostic value of the straight leg raise test. They discuss how this test can exacerbate patients with radicular symptoms. They recommend all practitioners learn how to perform and interpret this test.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh is referred to as the FABER test and is used to evaluate for sacroiliitis which can present with lower back pain and pain in the buttocks. This exam maneuver will cause intense pain in patients who have inflammation of the joint. Treatment is with physical therapy and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer B: Internal rotation of the extended hip is the Freiberg test which evaluates for piriformis syndrome. Piriformis syndrome presents with lower back pain similar to a herniated disc; however, is less likely to have occurred after a single lifting episode and does not typically present with electrical pain that originates in the buttocks.\n\nAnswer C: Palpating the paraspinal muscles is a non-specific test that could further support a diagnosis of a muscle strain. It will likely not provide much information in the diagnosis of a herniated disc. Patients with muscle strain can be treated conservatively with relative rest and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer D: Radiography is unlikely to offer information regarding this patient's herniated disc. While it can detect bony abnormalities, the detail of this imaging modality will not depict a herniated disc.

It initially presents with a vague constellation of symptoms including fatigue, fevers, easy bleeding/bruising, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and possibly testicular enlargement. The diagnosis is supported when the white blood cell count (which can be low, normal, or high) demonstrates increased lymphoblasts. Further confirmatory testing may include testing for the 12:21 translocation, which is more common with a better prognosis, or the 9:22 translocation (the Philadelphia chromosome), which is less common and denotes a poor prognosis.\n\nOnciu reviews ALL. He notes that ALL has a high cure rate with intensive chemotherapeutic regimens and that new research is improving outcomes in this very common condition. He recommends early treatment with these regimens for an improved prognosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and is more common in the elderly. Patients will present with systemic symptoms, weight loss, anorexia, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding including gingival bleeding and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract), and neutropenia (predisposing patients to life-threatening infection). Myeloblasts produce increased amounts of myeloperoxidase which can lead to the formation of Auer rods that can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells and presents with a leukocyte count > 50,000/mm3. There are different presentations for this condition. Most patients present in the chronic phase with minimal symptoms (and a low blast count); however, they can also present with an accelerated phase and a blast phase which can lead to a hematologic emergency termed a blast crisis which may cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\nAnswer D: Leukemoid reaction is an overly robust immune reaction (often to infection) that resembles chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level is elevated. This elevated level indicates it is a robust immune response rather than increased cell levels from malignancy.\n\nAnswer E: Parvovirus B19 infection presents with erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) which may include \"slapped cheek\" rash, fever, malaise, and possibly respiratory symptoms. In healthy patients, symptoms are usually minimal and self-limited. However, in patients with hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease), the transient halt in erythropoiesis that occurs in addition to hemolysis may lead to significant anemia requiring transfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia presents in pediatric patients with pancytopenia, fatigue, repeat infections, easy bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and increased blast cells on peripheral smear.", "realidx": 138, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 5-year-old boy with specific symptoms and laboratory findings.

A detailed workup is not needed if the clinical story is clear, but an orthostatic test can be completed. One way to do this is to assess the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon. Another way requires the patient to collect urine at multiple times throughout the day. A diagnosis is confirmed if the morning sample is protein-free but the evening sample contains protein. In general, pediatric patients with orthostatic proteinuria should have under 1 gram of protein in a full 24 hours.

These symptoms and signs in this patient are most consistent with adrenal tuberculosis requiring RIPE therapy (rifamycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) as well as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to dysfunction at the level of the adrenal glands themselves, as opposed to upstream factors such as the pituitary gland. Primary adrenal insufficiency in developed nations is most often caused by autoimmune disease. In developing nations, adrenal tuberculosis is a significant cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal tuberculosis often presents with a history of tuberculosis or tuberculosis symptoms, as well as symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and hyperpigmentation. Patients often have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, low morning cortisol, a failed cosyntropin test, and high ACTH concentrations. Radiography may demonstrate bilateral adrenal calcifications, and/or adrenal enlargement. Tuberculosis can infect all cortices of the adrenal glands bilaterally, and therefore treatment requires eradicating the infection with multi-drug therapy (RIPE therapy) as well as replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, which may be achieved by high-dose hydrocortisone or other combinations of steroids that together provide glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.\n\nVinnard and Blumberg outline the signs and symptoms, histopathology, lab results, imaging, differential diagnosis, and treatments associated with adrenal tuberculosis. They recommend early recognition and treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bilateral adrenalectomy, prednisone therapy, and fludrocortisone therapy are incorrect because medical therapy should first be attempted to eradicate the infection before undergoing surgery. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be considered if there is suspicion of lung cancer with metastasis to the bilateral adrenal glands. Patients will require lifelong replacement therapy.\n\nAnswer B: Dexamethasone alone is incorrect because this patient likely has tuberculosis and should be treated for it. Additionally, this patient has signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), and patients often require mineralocorticoid therapy or a high dose of a glucocorticoid with mineralocorticoid activity (e.g., hydrocortisone). Dexamethasone has minimal to absent mineralocorticoid activity.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone therapy and immunoglobulin therapy are incorrect because this patient has adrenal tuberculosis. Although autoimmune adrenalitis can cause primary adrenal insufficiency, immunoglobulins are not used to treat this condition.\n\nAnswer D: Prednisone taper would be appropriate for acute conditions such as an asthma or COPD exacerbation. While prednisone will treat the symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency, it will not treat active tuberculosis infection. Primary adrenal insufficiency in developed nations is most often caused by autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison disease) and presents with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, and muscle weakness.

The most appropriate initial management for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide.\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart does not pump effectively and can be due to either difficulty with relaxation in diastole or contraction in systole or a combination of both. Risk factors for this condition include myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Left-sided HF leads to decreased forward flow into the systemic circulation and increased congestion in the pulmonary circulation which clinically manifests as shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and crackles on lung exam. Early pulmonary edema leads to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch which causes hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate, which leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. The most appropriate initial treatment for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide, which helps alleviate fluid overload. Other treatments for acute exacerbations may include nitroglycerin (in hypertensive patients) and BIPAP.\n\nYancy et al. discuss the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of heart failure. They review current testing and treatment regimens. Acute episodes may be managed with loop diuretics to reduce volume overload and improve symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ivabradine inhibits the funny current, an electrical current that leads to spontaneous depolarization in pacemaker cells, leading to decreased heart rate. It reduces the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, it should not be started in ADHF due to lack of mortality benefit and should be held in ADHF patients with severe decompensation due to decreased heart rate leading to decreased cardiac output.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that reduces mortality when used in patients with chronic HFrEF. However, beta-blockers can worsen decompensated HFrEF due to negative inotropy and should not be started in ADHF.\n\nAnswer D: Sacubitril and valsartan is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that improves mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF. ARNIs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be started in ADHF due to concern for hypotension and worsening renal function. However, either an ARNI, ACE inhibitor or ARB should be started prior to discharge.\n\nAnswer E: Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that reduces mortality in chronic HFrEF.

Symptoms include bulbar muscle weakness and type 2 respiratory failure (inadequate alveolar ventilation). The most appropriate initial step in management is to maintain adequate respiratory function by intubation. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is used to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from circulation, and steroids are started for long-term therapy. Avoiding risk factors and pre-medication before procedures with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is important for preventing repeat occurrences.\n\nRodrigues et al. review the evidence regarding the occurrence of myasthenic crisis in patients with COVID.

He should undergo monofilament testing to assess the subsequent risk of developing foot ulcers.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is the most common underlying cause of diabetic foot ulcers. The pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulcers is thought to be the loss of pain and pressure sensation, which leads to muscular imbalance and foot deformities. This subsequently decreases microcirculation and impairs the integrity of the skin, leading to the formation of foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers, like other neuropathic ulcers, occur commonly under bony prominences in the foot. During monofilament testing, a 10-g monofilament is placed on the plantar surface of the foot at a right angle, and pressure is applied until the patient can no longer tolerate it or the filament buckles. Patients with diabetic neuropathy have a higher-pressure threshold due to loss of sensation, and this is a useful predictor of the severity of diabetic neuropathy and future foot ulcer formation. The management of diabetic neuropathy consists of tight glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure control, exercise, preventing complications, and pain management with pharmacotherapy (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or gabapentinoid antiseizure medications).\n\nTesfaye et al. study the efficacy of various first-line medications for diabetic nephropathy including amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin.

For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.", "realidx": 157, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 59-year-old man with transient neurological symptoms suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA).

In rare cases, the sequestration of blood in the cephalohematoma may cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that requires phototherapy but this is a rare complication. Treatment is with reassurance and outpatient monitoring.\n\nRaines et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cephalohematoma. They discuss how this injury presents gradually and does not cross suture lines. They recommend conservative treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: An incision and drainage procedure is contraindicated in cephalohematoma without signs of infection, such as erythema of the skin overlying the swelling. In cases where the cephalohematoma is thought to be secondarily infected, patients should undergo incision and drainage to prevent osteomyelitis. Patients would present with increasing pain, erythema, and systemic findings such as fever.\n\nAnswer B: Intensive phototherapy may be used to manage the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that may occur due to cephalohematoma, but the majority of cases resolve spontaneously. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia found in this patient does not necessitate phototherapy. Unconjugated bilirubin is produced due to the metabolism of hemoglobin.\n\nAnswer C: Neurosurgical decompression may be necessary to manage other neonatal birth injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhages. Because a cephalohematoma involves bleeding between the periosteum and skull (i.e., outside of the skull), it does not require neurosurgical intervention. Intracranial hemorrhages would present with asymmetric reflexes or obtundation.\n\nAnswer E: Red blood cell transfusions are sometimes necessary to manage intracranial hemorrhages in neonates with significant blood loss. They are not usually required to manage cephalohematoma as the bleeding in this condition is limited by the suture lines. Patients who are tachycardic or hypotensive may require transfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMost cases of cephalohematoma resolve spontaneously but can sometimes present with an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that requires treatment with phototherapy.", "realidx": 165, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a newborn with a swelling on the head.

{"question": "A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off a portion of his right index finger. The teacher applied dressings and pressure to the patient's injured digit and immediately transported the patient to the emergency department. He arrived within 20 minutes of the accident. The patient has a medical history of asthma and his only medication is albuterol. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 17/min. Exam was significant for pulsatile bleeding from a clean-cut wound on his right second finger. Radiography of the hand revealed a complete amputation of the right finger from the distal interphalangeal joint. The wound was cleaned, compression applied, analgesics administered, and the hand surgeons were notified. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but the principal would be transporting it to the hospital.

The correct way to transport an amputated digit is to rinse the finger in normal saline to remove gross contaminants, wrap the appendage in gauze moistened by normal saline, place it in a plastic bag, and then place the bag in ice water.\n\nAmputation injuries are common with finger and thumb amputations being the most common. With rapid and proper transport of the patient and appendage, successful reattachment could be possible pending a surgical evaluation. It is important to know how to appropriately package the severed digit so as to optimize tissue viability. Cooling with ice water can slow the metabolic rate of the tissue and result in less tissue damage; however, there is a delicate balance. There must be proper barriers between the digit and ice water to avoid ice burns which could compromise the tissue. Patients should be given IV antibiotics to prevent infection as well.\n\nZhang et al. note that once a finger amputation has occurred, ischemic tolerance times are 12 hours if warm and up to 24 hours if cold. For more proximal amputations, these times are halved due to the presence of muscle tissue, which can undergo irreversible changes after 6 hours of ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Rinsing the amputated finger with hydrogen peroxide could damage the tissue decreasing the chances of salvageability. Avoiding the use of caustic solutions with amputated appendages preserves tissue.\n\nAnswer C: Submerging the finger in ice water could lead to irreversible tissue damage and swelling making reattachment impossible.\n\nAnswer D: Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and then placing in a plastic bag is not enough to optimize a severed finger for transport. Cooling further with ice water is necessary in order to slow down tissue metabolism and prevent further ischemic damage.\n\nAnswer E: Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and placing it directly on ice could damage the finger by direct contact with ice rendering the amputated part non-viable.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe correct handling of an amputated appendage is to first rinse it off with normal saline to remove any gross debris, wrap it in normal saline soaked gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and then place that bag in ice water.", "realidx": 167, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a medical scenario involving the correct method for transporting an amputated finger.

{"question": "A 77-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden onset weakness in his right upper extremity. At home, the patient thought he was simply dehydrated, but he rapidly began to have trouble speaking. When his wife noted this she brought him into the hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient is not responding to verbal stimuli and only withdraws his left upper extremity and lower extremity to pain. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and atrial fibrillation treated with metoprolol, apixaban, and lisinopril. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has a seizure and subsequently demonstrates agonal breathing. He no longer responds to painful stimuli. A fingerstick blood glucose is 122 mg/dL.

Initially, his symptoms are in his right upper extremity, which then progresses to affect his speech and cause altered mental status, obtundation, and seizures, which is suggestive of a left-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.\n\nIntraparenchymal (IPH) cerebral hemorrhages often present with sudden-onset focal neurologic deficits. A unique feature is that IPHs tend to present with progressive/worsening symptoms in contrast to ischemic strokes which often demonstrate stable or improving symptoms. It is not uncommon for a patient to present with focal neurologic deficits, which then progress to seizures and obtundation. Risk factors include older age, hypertension, and blood thinners. The prognosis is poor in intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and outcomes are dependent on the size and location of the bleed. Initial workup should be centered on obtaining a fingerstick blood glucose, securing the airway, and obtaining CNS imaging (often with a non-contrast CT scan). Further management is centered on elevating the head of the bed, reversing the patient's anticoagulation status, and possible neurosurgical intervention (though prognosis is very poor in general).\n\nGross et al. review IPH. They note that IPH has very high morbidity and mortality even when treated. There is ongoing research into minimally invasive approaches for evacuation of primary IPH to optimize and improve outcomes, although immediate medical therapy is needed to reduce mortality which is recommended.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Epidural hematomas present after trauma with the \"talk and die\" syndrome beginning with a period of unconsciousness, a lucid interval, and then progressive obtundation. A CT of the head would demonstrate a lens-shaped lesion, and a burr hole to drain the collection of blood is the treatment of choice. Acute epidural hematomas do not typically begin spontaneously.\n\nAnswer C: Ischemic strokes present with sudden onset, focal neurologic deficits. Generally, after the initial ischemic event, patients will be stable or even note an improvement in their symptoms. It is less likely that this patient's progressive symptoms and seizures are caused by an ischemic stroke when compared to a hemorrhagic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This diagnosis is certainly possible, and further workup with CT imaging and possibly MRI is needed to clarify the diagnosis and direct further care.\n\nAnswer D: Subarachnoid hemorrhages generally present with a \"thunderclap\" headache with meningeal signs. It is possible that patients may present with obtundation and confusion with severe subarachnoid hemorrhages. Seizures are uncommon in subarachnoid hemorrhages and generally do not present with such focal neurologic deficits. CT will show blood in the subarachnoid space. The diagnosis can be supported with CTA or a lumbar puncture. Further management may involve nimodipine, neurosurgical intervention, and observation if the bleed is small and has stopped on its own.\n\nAnswer E: Subdural hematomas are more common in the elderly patients and patients with alcohol use disorder and present after trauma with a gradual progression of altered mental status to obtundation. Note that large subdural hematomas may present with a rapid progression of symptoms. CT of the head will demonstrate a crescent-shaped lesion that crosses suture lines.

As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam.

The mechanism of amenorrhea in the setting of anorexia nervosa relates to the same hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis at play in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea wherein the state of energy deficiency from inadequate caloric intake disrupts normal pulsatile GnRH secretion, leading to decreased FSH, LH, estrogen levels, and subsequent amenorrhea.\n\nAnswer C: Hypothyroidism is a cause of secondary amenorrhea wherein abnormal thyroid function can lead to altered levels of sex hormone-binding protein, prolactin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thus causing menstrual dysfunction. This patient does not present with other signs of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, sensitivity to cold, dry skin, muscle weakness, weight gain, constipation, joint stiffness, or thinning hair.\n\nAnswer D: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition often associated with obesity in which hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance is hypothesized to alter the hypothalamus feedback response, leading to the increased luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, increased androgen levels, and decreased rate of follicular maturation leading to unruptured follicles. Patients will often present with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, and decreased fertility.\n\nAnswer E: Pregnancy is a cause of secondary amenorrhea that is less likely in this patient given her lack of sexual history and other associated symptoms such as decreased appetite, nausea, and insomnia. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) test should always be part of the workup for secondary amenorrhea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a condition in which caloric restriction, increased energy expenditure through exercise, and/or increased stress leads to a disrupted pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with the downstream effect of amenorrhea.", "realidx": 176, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette describing a 17-year-old girl with secondary amenorrhea.

Whereas the eviscerated bowel in gastroschisis is not covered by a membrane, the exposed bowel in the omphalocele is covered by a membranous sac. The abdominal wall defect in gastroschisis is located lateral to the umbilicus, whereas in omphalocele the defect is midline. The distinction is also important for management, as omphalocele is commonly associated with other extraintestinal defects whereas fewer than 10% of cases of gastroschisis are associated with an extraintestinal abnormality.

The most appropriate next step in management is a fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\nThe first step in the diagnostic work-up of a thyroid nodule, which can be found incidentally in asymptomatic individuals or in the presence of obstructive or vocal symptoms, includes an ultrasound and measurement of serum TSH levels. If TSH is normal or elevated, this suggests a hypofunctioning (\u201ccold\u201d) nodule, which increases the risk of cancer. These nodules should undergo FNA if suspicious sonographic findings are present. Suspicious sonographic findings include irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, and rim calcifications in nodules \u2265 1 cm in diameter. If TSH is low, then thyroid scintigraphy (radioiodine scan) should be performed to confirm whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (\u201chot\u201d). Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely cancerous, so these patients can often avoid FNA. Hyperfunctioning nodules such as toxic adenomas which cause overt hyperthyroid symptoms may warrant further treatment with radioiodine, surgery, or anti-thyroid medications.\n\nDurante et al. review the epidemiology and diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules. The authors find that nodules with suspicious sonographic patterns such as solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should undergo cytological evaluation. The authors recommend molecular testing only in cases in which cytology is indeterminate.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Propylthiouracil is a thionamide that inhibits thyroid peroxidase, thus preventing thyroid hormone synthesis.

Risk factors for AAA include advanced age (> 60 years), smoking history, male sex, and history of atherosclerosis. AAA can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic until it markedly expands or ruptures, leading to abdominal pain, back pain, or flank pain. The evaluation of suspected AAA depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the existence of an AAA. A hemodynamically unstable patient with a known history of AAA should be assumed to have a ruptured AAA and undergo surgical intervention without further workup (though bedside ultrasound can support the diagnosis). In an unstable patient without a known history, a bedside ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis should precede surgical intervention. In a hemodynamically stable patient with or without a known AAA history, an abdominal CTA is appropriate.\n\nSakalihasan et al. present a review of the presentation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

This is a rare entity and is less likely in this patient. Treatment is immediate transcatheter arterial embolization for unstable patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer B: Aortic dissection has similar risk factors to AAA (history of hypertension, advanced age) and also presents with acute onset back pain.

Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased.

Elevation of urine albumin warrants treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Blood pressure control slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy should be started on a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Patients with persistent albuminuria despite both ACE/ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy should be started on the nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone.\n\nBakris et al. study the efficacy of finerenone, a nonsteroidal selective MRA, in the treatment of patients with albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes.

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs.

While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred.

It is associated with risk factors such as recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, and advanced age. Diagnosis is established via a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxins and C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), or a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for C. difficile toxins. The GDH enzyme immunoassay is highly sensitive for detecting C. difficile, but not specific for toxin-producing C. difficile, and thus the toxin enzyme immunoassay is submitted in conjunction. If the results of both are discordant, then NAAT is used to make the diagnosis. Treatment for C. difficile infection differs by disease severity and recurrence. Commonly used medications include fidaxomicin and oral vancomycin.\n\nMcDonald et al. review the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile and provide the algorithm for C. difficile testing as mentioned above. The authors also note that only liquid stool from patients with clinically significant and acute diarrhea should be submitted for testing. The authors recommend that formed stool from asymptomatic patients should not be tested because the presence of the C. difficile toxin gene does not distinguish between infection and asymptomatic carriage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is an appropriate adjunctive diagnostic tool in patients with severe disease (e.g., severe abdominal pain and distension, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis, marked leukocytosis) or fulminant colitis (marked by hypotension and ileus) to evaluate for toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention. In patients who are stable with low concern for severe disease or fulminant colitis, it would not be the preferred initial test for diagnosis nor would it be confirmatory.\n\nAnswer B: CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast is the preferred modality for detecting the presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention in the setting of C. difficile colitis. Colonic dilatation of > 7 cm in diameter in the clinical setting of severe C. difficile infection is diagnostic. Other findings may include small bowel dilatation or scalloping of the bowel wall due to submucosal edema. While it would be reasonable to perform a CT scan in this patient, it would not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate for cases in which an alternative diagnosis is suspected that requires direct visualization and/or biopsy of the bowel mucosa. It may also be helpful for patients with ileus or colitis in the absence of diarrhea as it allows for visualization of pseudomembranes on the inflamed mucosal surface, which are highly suggestive of C. difficile infection. In general, colonoscopy is a preferred and more accurate test.\n\nAnswer D: Rectal swab for selective anaerobic culture involves culture on a selective medium with toxin testing of isolated C. difficile. It is a highly sensitive test, but culture cannot distinguish toxin-producing strains from non-toxin-producing strains. A second test is required to detect toxin production by the cultured C. difficile strain (either enzyme immunoassay or nucleic acid amplification testing). Culture takes several days to finalize and as such, it is seldom used to establish a clinical diagnosis.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) characterized by prominent irritability and disruption of everyday life.\n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of PMS characterized by recurrent physical and behavioral symptoms that manifest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve with menstruation. The diagnosis is made by criteria outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). To make a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, symptoms such as marked affective lability or marked irritability or anger must be present along with signs such as decreased concentration, hypersomnia or insomnia, and decreased interest in usual activities. These symptoms must cause significant distress or interfere with work, school, or relationships and must present 1 week before the onset of menses and resolve the week following menses. The initial management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder involves a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy and a menstrual diary to prospectively confirm symptoms and their relationship to the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Following confirmation of a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, treatment involves lifestyle changes, antidepressant/anxiolytic medications, or hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nBhatia et al. discuss premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

These symptoms include sleep disturbance, anhedonia, guilt, loss of energy, loss of concentration, appetite/weight changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidal ideation. Though this patient exhibits some of these symptoms, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a more likely diagnosis as she exhibits these symptoms temporally related to her menstrual cycle.\n\nAnswer C: Panic disorder is characterized by 4 or more panic attacks (sweating, palpitations, shaking, paresthesias) in a 4-week period or \u2265 1 panic attack followed by at least 1 month of fear of another panic attack. Though this patient experiences anxiety that leads her to avoid her work, she does not have any of the characteristic signs of a panic attack and therefore does not meet the criteria for diagnosis of panic disorder.\n\nAnswer E: PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder have overlap in their symptoms; however, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by symptoms that significantly affect daily functioning.

{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was running a marathon but became confused halfway through the race.

Physical exam reveals a confused man who is moving all 4 extremities and is protecting his airway. During the exam, he develops a tonic-clonic seizure, which lasts 1 minute and then terminates on its own. The patient is given intravenous fluids, and basic laboratory studies are drawn and pending. A urine dipstick is positive for red blood cells. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on laboratory testing?", "answer": "Hypocalcemia", "options": {"A": "Hyperkalemia", "B": "Hyperphosphatemia", "C": "Hyperuricemia", "D": "Hypocalcemia", "E": "Hyponatremia"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).", "realidx": 204, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 27-year-old man who experiences altered mental status and a seizure during a marathon.

This site is particularly prone to fracture due to the thin bone separating the coronoid and olecranon fossae in the supracondylar region. Due to the proximity of the brachial artery and median nerve, which course anteriorly, these structures are at risk for injury. Neurapraxia of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is a pure motor branch of the median nerve, presents as motor deficits in interphalangeal (IP) joint flexion of the thumb and distal IP joint flexion of the index finger. The radial and ulnar arteries are terminal branches of the brachial artery, which if injured results in diminished distal pulses. The diagnosis is made with anteroposterior and lateral view elbow radiographs. Radiographs will demonstrate the \"fat pad sign\" seen as a posterior fat pad that is indicative of fracture. Management depends on fracture type but can consist of cast immobilization (if minimally displaced with no neurovascular injury) or closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (for more displaced fractures).\n\nMicheloni et al. reviews supracondylar fractures in children.

The first step in management of patients with blunt trauma and hemodynamic instability is a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST exam)\n\nFor any patient with blunt or penetrating trauma, the first step in management is an evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation. This is referred to as the primary survey and includes the verification of endotracheal tube placement, auscultation of bilateral breath sounds, and assessment of external wounds or bleeding. This is followed by the secondary survey which involves a detailed head to toe inspection for injuries. Blunt abdominal trauma with bruising as well as hemodynamic instability warrants a FAST exam. The FAST exam visualizes the heart chambers and pericardium, left upper quadrant (spleen, splenorenal recess), right upper quadrant (Morrison pouch) and the rectovesical (males) or rectouterine (females) pouch. The extended FAST exam (eFAST) includes an examination of the lungs as well to assess for pneumothorax or hemothorax.

Patients with hemodynamic instability and a negative FAST exam should be evaluated for sources of bleeding elsewhere such as the pelvis.\n\nBarloon et al. review diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma is a common cause of death and injury, leading to hemodynamic instability.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Blood vessel narrowing", "options": {"A": "Blood vessel narrowing", "B": "Cardiac dysrhythmia", "C": "Seizure", "D": "Stroke", "E": "Vagal event"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This elderly patient with risk factors for vascular disease (diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension) is presenting with episodes of dizziness, vertigo, numbness/tingling, dysarthria, and syncope, which seem to be provoked by standing rapidly and changing head position. This is concerning for vertebrobasilar syndrome, caused by blood vessel narrowing.\n\nVertebrobasilar syndrome is caused by narrowing (via causes such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or congenital narrowing among others) of the vertebrobasilar vascular system. It is a common cause of syncope that may be worsened by changes in head position or standing rapidly. Other unique features include numbness/tingling, a sensation of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Note the episodes of syncope in this condition are intermittent and specifically provoked and do not have lasting/permanent neurological deficits in contrast to a stroke. Management is first centered on vascular imaging which may include a CTA head/neck or an MRA head/neck. Further care depends on the symptoms present but typically involves smoking cessation, glycemic control, blood pressure control, aspirin, and a statin.\n\nXuan-Ting et al. review posterior circulation strokes which occur more frequently in patients with atherosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar system. They note that MRI is one of the most accurate tests for assessing posterior circulation strokes which may present with dizziness and syncope. It is far superior to CT imaging. For this reason, they recommend that CT imaging alone cannot definitively rule out a posterior circulation stroke.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia can cause sudden onset and offset syncope without prodromal symptoms. The differentiating feature of this form of syncope is the rapid onset and offset in a high-risk patient. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an ECG; however, many patients will require prolonged observation on telemetry.\n\nAnswer C: Seizure presents with impaired consciousness, tonic-clonic activity, and a post-ictal state which gradually improves over hours. The lactate may be elevated after a seizure, and the prolactin level is a more specific indicator of a seizure. However, the diagnosis is most appropriately made based on history, exam, and EEG.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke involving the vertebrobasilar system may cause syncope in addition to ongoing dizziness and vertigo with ataxia. However, this patient's symptoms seem to be positional and have entirely resolved; thus, a stroke is unlikely. He is at higher risk of stroke given his vertebrobasilar insufficiency and an MRI should still be performed in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Vagal event presents with a warm prodrome with palpitations, flushing, and syncope. Muscle twitching (but no tonic-clonic activity) may be seen.

Since the patient is young and healthy, oral hydration and rest are all that is needed for management.\n\nDiarrheal illness is a common chief complaint with variable workups pending on the patient's clinical status. Young, healthy, non-immunosuppressed patients who can tolerate an oral diet require only reassurance and oral hydration, as most cases of viral and bacterial diarrhea will resolve on their own. Moreover, most cases of diarrhea are caused by viral etiologies which simply require supportive therapy. This is even true in bacterial diarrhea as long as the patient's vitals normalize and they can tolerate an oral diet. It is important to consider inflammatory causes of diarrhea (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease) as this would change the workup and management.\n\nSchiller et al. discuss different types of diarrhea.

They recommend noting the difference between different causes and working up and treating them appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that can be used for bacterial/infectious diarrhea. It should not be given in young, healthy patients and would only be indicated in the setting of bacterial diarrhea in ill patients, patients with persistent symptoms, or patients who are immunosuppressed. Bacterial diarrhea would present with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody/purulent diarrhea.\n\nAnswer C: Stool culture should not be empirically performed in young, well-appearing patients.

The cause is unclear and thought to be autoimmune. The main diagnostic markers are a high FSH and low estradiol at the start of the follicular phase. Patients require estrogen supplementation until around age 50, as low estrogen increases the risk of coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, and sexual dysfunction.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.", "realidx": 226, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 25-year-old man with altered mental status.

Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery.

These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation.

IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV.

{"question": "A study is performed that looks at individuals who suffer from opioid use disorder and the effect the disorder has on their daily life and functionality. Individuals are surveyed using a validated method and followed up in 6-month intervals for 5 years. At the end of the study period, 40% of individuals have replied to the survey throughout the entire period. Analyzing only those subjects who responded throughout the entire period, it is determined that opioid use disorder only minimally impairs individuals in their daily functioning. Which of the following most likely occurred in this study?", "answer": "Attrition bias", "options": {"A": "Attrition bias", "B": "Confounding variable", "C": "Late-look bias", "D": "Recall bias", "E": "Volunteer bias"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This study following individuals who abuse opioids with a 40% follow-up response rate suggests that opioid use disorder (known for impairing daily functioning) has only a minor effect on patient functionality. This is most likely secondary to attrition bias, or a loss to follow-up of participants in a non-random fashion whereby more severe cases stopped responding and were thus left out.\n\nBias in studies distorts outcomes and can make interpreting results challenging. For this reason, it is important to be meticulous when designing a study with every effort to minimize bias. The attrition bias can occur when individuals are lost to follow-up in a non-random fashion. For example, consider the assessment of daily functionality via a validated method in individuals with coronary artery disease. Those who are severely impaired from disease progression may not follow up in this study, thus altering results and removing more severe cases from the analysis. Having a higher response rate can help mitigate this bias, but is more costly as it may be difficult to ensure that every participant follows up.\n\nNunan et al. discuss the attrition bias. They note how it can affect studies and the data collected. They recommend mitigating the attrition bias for more accurate results and clinical application.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Confounding variables are variables that are correlated with the studied variable that better explain the difference between 2 groups. For example, it may be found that alcohol is associated with lung cancer when in reality, the confounding variable of smoking (more common in individuals who drink alcohol) explains this difference.\n\nAnswer C: Late-look bias occurs when patients with severe disease are not studied because they are dead, critically ill, or unavailable to be studied, making the disease overall appear less severe. For example, patients with HIV may not have increased morbidity and mortality in a study. However, this may be a result of all the critically ill cases being too sick or dead and thus unable to participate thus distorting the outcome.\n\nAnswer D: Recall bias occurs when individuals with disease or an adverse outcome are more likely to recall an exposure given the occurred outcome, skewing their memory and thus the results. For example, pregnant mothers who have a newborn with a defect or condition may be more likely to recall certain exposures (such as exposure to pollution).\n\nAnswer E: Volunteer bias occurs when people who volunteer for a study are fundamentally different from the general population or those who do not volunteer.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data.

The most likely diagnosis is a lumbar strain.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of low back pain is broad and includes mechanical causes such as lumbar strain, osteoarthritis, spondylolisthesis, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and fractures as well as non-mechanical etiologies such as osteomyelitis and malignancy. History and physical should focus on eliciting red flag symptoms, including traumatic etiology, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), history of malignancy, intravenous drug use, steroid use, and neurological deficits (e.g., saddle anesthesia, incontinence). The presence of any red flags should prompt further evaluation with imaging. Lumbar strain typically presents with acute low back pain after a precipitating event (e.g., lifting weight) with no red flag signs/symptoms and responds well to conservative management including activity modification, ice, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prevention measures include strengthening of core muscles and education on proper lifting techniques. Physical therapy is a core component of treating patients with muscle strains.\n\nKnezevic et al. review lower back pain. They note the many potential causes and symptoms that may present. They recommend a multimodal interdisciplinary approach to back pain given the many mechanisms, especially in complex cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Disc herniation presents with radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots as they exit the spinal canal, manifesting as a burning or shooting pain that radiates down either leg. Dermatomal sensory changes or hyporeflexia may be present depending on the spinal level affected (e.g., reduced Achilles reflex with S1 radiculopathy). The straight leg raise reproduces pain radiating down the leg on the affected side.\n\nAnswer B: Lumbar stenosis characteristically causes low back pain or lower extremity paresthesias with walking or standing that resolves when leaning forward (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d). This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. Involvement of spinal nerve roots can lead to sensory loss and weakness in the lower extremities.\n\nAnswer D: Osteoarthritis can cause low back pain and stiffness, but is an age-related degenerative disease that is less likely in this patient who presents acutely after activity. The patient also does not have the typical risk factors for osteoarthritis, which include advanced age, female sex, or obesity.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fracture occurs mainly in osteoporotic patients, whose reduced bone mineral density increases their risk for vertebral body collapse under stress. Vertebral compression fractures present with point tenderness at the midline over the site of fracture.

In the setting of his reduced appetite and trouble sleeping, mirtazapine is an appropriate medication to add.\n\nSSRIs (including paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and fluoxetine) are the first line treatment for major depression. For patients in whom an adequate trial of SSRI therapy has been ineffective, the first step in management is a trial of augmentation with a separate agent prior to switching to a different primary antidepressant medication. Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, acts by inhibiting pre-synaptic alpha-2 receptors as well as 5HT2 and 5HT3 serotonin receptors. Notably, its side effect profile includes increased appetite and mild sleepiness, making it a good option for depressed patients with insomnia or decreased appetite. Mirtazapine is commonly used to augment primary antidepressant therapy.

Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis.

In a systems-based approach, there is an algorithmic method set in place for situations where errors are common. Examples of systems-based approaches to avoiding medical errors include time-outs for procedures, use of the electronic medical record and ordering system to generate stops and checks, and built-in procedures such as a pharmacist verifying all medical orders. The best way to prevent future errors, when possible, is a systems-based approach as it does not rely solely on individuals given that individuals are fallible and may not always avoid mistakes.\n\nCondren et al. review a systems based approach in the medical system. They note that a systems-based approach reduces medication errors. For this reason, systems-based approaches are recommended whenever possible.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Entering medications only on morning rounds with multiple providers is not a plausible strategy as patients will not receive medications they may need at other times, such as overnight. It is always a good idea to verify medications with the team on morning rounds to catch any possible errors that may be missed, but this would not necessarily fix errors that occur at other times of the day.\n\nAnswer C: Having nursing perform the medication reconciliation is not the best solution in this case, as the core problem was that the wrong medication was entered due to similar-sounding medication names. However, it is always a good idea to have multiple providers (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) verify information, check this with the physician team, and then verify the dose and route of administration when giving the medication.\n\nAnswer D: Reprimanding and educating the resident to check medications more carefully is not a solution to this problem. It does not seem that the resident does not understand the pharmacology or medication prescribed but made an understandable error. Explaining the need for care is important; reprimanding the resident is not.\n\nAnswer E: Verifying the patient\u2019s home medications with the patient should always be performed, but it would not fix this issue with similar-sounding medications. It would catch errors such as new medications that are not on the patient\u2019s medication list or out-of-date medications remaining on the list.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA systems-based approach is the most appropriate way to prevent future errors from occurring.", "realidx": 251, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a scenario involving a medication error during a patient's admission process.

{"question": "A 26-year-old medical student presents to occupational health after sustaining a needlestick injury. She was drawing blood from an HIV-positive patient when she stuck herself percutaneously while capping the needle. She immediately washed the puncture wound with saline. The medical student has had a negative HIV serology from the beginning of medical school 2 years ago. She is monogamous with one male partner and denies any intravenous drug use.

The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection.

The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis.

Given his history of heavy smoking, lung cancer should be ruled out with a chest CT with possible subsequent bronchoscopy for tissue biopsy.\n\nRecurrent pneumonia can be classified either as those confined to 1 anatomical location of the lung or those involving different portions of the lung. If recurrent pneumonia is limited to a single region, the patient should be evaluated for an anatomic obstruction, such as a mass or mucous plug. Obstruction will hinder mucociliary clearance and allow for the proliferation of bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. The most concerning etiology of such an obstruction is a tumor causing external bronchial compression. Thus, patients should be screened with a chest CT to rule out lung cancer in these cases. If lesions are identified on CT, subsequent bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy may be warranted. Treatment may involve radiotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or surgery depending on the underlying malignancy. Other causes of recurrent pneumonia limited to an anatomical region include recurrent aspiration secondary to tracheoesophageal disorders or seizures.\n\nPurysko et al. discuss the role of contrast enhancement in chest CTs. The authors find common indications for contrast-enhanced chest CTs include investigation for pulmonary embolism, pleural pathology, or hilar pathology. The authors recommend against the regular use of contrast enhancement in chest CTs outside of selected indications as they rarely provide additional diagnostic benefits while subjecting the patient to the risk of adverse effects with contrast agents.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Barium swallow is often done to investigate anatomical abnormalities of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as tracheoesophageal fistula or Zenker diverticulum.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations.

A patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability should be ascertained immediately as it determines the most appropriate next step in management. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive and tachycardic), a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam should be immediately performed to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding, and ob/gyn should be immediately consulted for emergent surgical intervention (e.g., salpingectomy or salpingotomy). In patients who are hemodynamically stable, transvaginal ultrasound should be performed to determine the gestational sac location, and medical therapy can be initiated (e.g., methotrexate therapy, depending on the size and location of the pregnancy).\n\nCheng et al. compare fertility outcomes of salpingotomy and salpingectomy in women with tubal pregnancies. The authors found that there was no difference in intrauterine pregnancy rates or repeat ectopic pregnancy rates between patients that underwent salpingotomy or salpingectomy. The authors recommend that both salpingectomy and salpingotomy are reasonable options for the surgical management of tubal pregnancies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT of the abdomen and pelvis is useful in determining if there is an intra-abdominal hemorrhage in patients who are hemodynamically stable.

If the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone (beta-hCG level 1,500-2,500 IU/L), then it should be repeated in 48 hours.\n\nAnswer E: Transvaginal ultrasound is reserved for hemodynamically stable patients who are presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding with abdominal/pelvic pain.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients who present with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemodynamic instability are managed with emergent surgical intervention.", "realidx": 264, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 26-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of a possible ectopic pregnancy or another acute gynecological condition.

A history of abdominal surgery is a risk factor for SBO due to the formation of adhesions. Patients with SBO can typically be managed conservatively including nasogastric tube suction (if discomfort and active vomiting), bowel rest, and intravenous fluid resuscitation.

In patients without significant trauma, the presence of signs of spinal cord compression (e.g., urinary retention, bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia, focal neurologic deficits), history of or strong risk factors for cancer, signs of infection, or risk of vertebral compression fracture should prompt additional work-up with imaging such as radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging. If none of these findings are present (most patients with acute low back pain in the primary care setting), then conservative therapy for 4-6 weeks consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with or without physical therapy is indicated.\n\nPatel and Ogle review the management of acute low back pain in the primary care setting. They outline the Waddell signs, which indicate the presence of a functional (signs of excessive pain behavior) aspect of pain. The authors recommend surgical evaluation only in patients with worsening neurologic deficits or intractable pain resistant to conservative treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Herniated discs occurs when the nucleus pulposus herniates through a weakened part of the annulus fibrosus of an intervertebral disc, resulting in spinal nerve root compression. This causes radicular findings at the level of compression, including weakness in hip abduction and ankle dorsiflexion with L5 involvement and weakness in ankle plantarflexion and reduced Achilles reflex with S1 involvement, and radiation of pain into the ipsilateral lower extremity. The straight leg raise test would be positive, as it exacerbates the nerve root compression.\n\nAnswer C: Multiple myeloma presents with hypercalcemia, anemia, renal failure, and lytic bone lesions causing bone pain. This patient has no constitutional symptoms to suggest a malignant process and has a mild elevation in serum calcium, which is likely due to her thiazide diuretic. The clear association of her back pain with exertion makes lumbosacral strain more likely.\n\nAnswer D: Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebral body is forwardly subluxated relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This presents as back pain alleviated by rest. Since this can narrow the spinal canal, it may also present with neurogenic claudication, manifesting as buttock or leg pain with walking that can be alleviated by bending forward.

His elevated troponin is likely secondary to poor renal clearance and dehydration, which is most appropriately addressed with IV fluids such as Ringer lactate.\n\nTroponin is a lab marker classically thought to be elevated when there is an injury to the heart causing leakage of this enzyme from the cardiac myocyte. However, there are many possible causes of an elevated troponin that may not be directly cardiac in nature or related to myocardial ischemia. Acute kidney injury is a common cause of an elevated troponin. For this reason, patients with an elevated troponin with kidney dysfunction without any cardiac symptoms or ECG changes should have their renal etiology addressed, and this will often clear the troponin. In the setting of a prerenal injury (dehydration causing poor kidney perfusion and a BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1), IV fluids will restore perfusion and treat the underlying cause. Patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure should have an ECG obtained and their current troponin should be compared to previous troponin levels to ensure it is not higher than their baseline. If there is uncertainty regarding a troponin level, it can be trended to see if it is rising, falling, or staying the same. Correlation with clinical symptoms is important when evaluating an elevated troponin level.\n\nMasri et al. review the causes of an elevated troponin. They note that a troponin elevation can be seen in myopericarditis, renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, rhabdomyolysis, stroke, and many other possible causes that are not related to myocardial infarction. They recommend keeping a broad differential and correlating the troponin with the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin would be appropriate management of an elevated troponin secondary to acute coronary syndrome as its antiplatelet activity reduces mortality. It should be administered prior to performing an ECG in patients with chest pain thought to be from a cardiac etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization is appropriate management of a ST elevation myocardial infarction, which presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and ST elevation within a vascular distribution with reciprocal changes on ECG. This patient has no cardiac symptoms and has a better alternative explanation for their troponin elevation.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol and aspirin may be indicated in acute coronary syndrome, and metoprolol would reduce this patient's heart rate. However, note that this patient's tachycardia is secondary to volume depletion; thus, beta-blockade for sinus tachycardia is inappropriate and may make the patient hemodynamically unstable.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a urinalysis and creatine phosphokinase level may be performed in rhabdomyolysis which presents in the setting of seizures, electrical shock, heatstroke, or with vigorous exertion. Patients will complain of muscle pain, oliguria, and dark urine. Management is centered on the administration of large volumes of fluid to protect the kidney and clear the toxic myoglobin.

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori.

{"question": "A 53-year-old African-American woman presents to her primary care doctor with increasing difficulty climbing the stairs. She noticed the weakness approximately 3 months ago. It has gotten progressively worse since that time. She has also noticed increasing difficulty combing her hair, standing from a seated position, and experiences muscle aches. Her medical history is significant for hypertension treated with lifestyle modification and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The most accurate diagnostic test for polymyositis is muscle biopsy.\n\nPolymyositis is caused by an autoimmune reaction that leads to cell-mediated cytotoxicity against unidentified skeletal muscle antigens, primarily affecting the endomysium. It is more often found in women, patients between 30-60 years of age, and African-Americans. Clinical features of polymyositis include symmetric proximal muscle weakness that may be accompanied by myalgia, dysphagia (due to pharyngeal muscle weakness), restrictive lung disease (due to respiratory muscle weakness), cardiac involvement (myocarditis, heart failure), interstitial lung disease, and increased risk of malignancy. There are no accepted diagnostic criteria for polymyositis; however, diagnosis is usually secured with a combination of clinical features and other tests. Routine initial studies can include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, creatine kinase, autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1), and electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy of an affected muscle is the gold standard for diagnosis and will typically show muscle fiber damage, CD8+ T cells in the endomysium, and overexpression of MHC-I on the sarcolemma. First-line treatment of polymyositis includes glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing agent (methotrexate, azathioprine). Subsequent treatments can include intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab, or plasmapheresis.\n\nAmato et al. review the evaluation and treatment of inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. They found that polymyositis typically presents in adult life with symmetric proximal leg greater than arm weakness. They recommend that a muscle biopsy be done on any patient considered to have polymyositis, preferably prior to starting immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Electromyography (EMG) can help distinguish myopathic weakness (e.g., polymyositis) from neuropathic causes of weakness (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). Characteristic EMG findings include fibrillations, early recruitment of motor unit potentials, and abnormal low-amplitude motor unit potentials. EMG is not a confirmatory test and is less sensitive than muscle biopsy for diagnosing myositis.\n\nAnswer B: MRI can be used to demonstrate areas of edema, atrophy, fatty replacement, and calcification in patients with suspected polymyositis. MRI can assess large regions of muscle, thus avoiding sampling error with muscle biopsy. The findings in MRI are nonspecific and require correlation with muscle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. MRI can also be used to help select the site of muscle biopsy.\n\nAnswer D: Serum aldolase can occasionally be used in the diagnostic investigation of suspected polymyositis if creatine kinase is normal. Aldolase elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in fasciitis, drug-induced myositis, and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease.\n\nAnswer E: Serum creatine kinase (CK) is the most sensitive muscle enzyme exam and should be part of the initial diagnostic investigation of any patient with suspected polymyositis. CK elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in myriad conditions such as inflammatory insult, metabolic injury, drug-induced injury, and infection.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMuscle biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of polymyositis.", "realidx": 277, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 53-year-old African-American woman with symptoms suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder.

They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile.

IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms.

The typical first-line medication is an SSRI. SSRIs may take at least 4 weeks or more to begin working, so patients that return before this time period should be reassured and encouraged to let the medication take effect as long as they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts or intent. If the medication is not working after at least 4 weeks, the next steps in management could include increasing the dose of the current medication, changing SSRIs, adding another antidepressant agent, or adding a low dose of levothyroxine.

CJD is usually spontaneous. Rarely, CJD may be familial or acquired (from iatrogenic transmission or dietary exposure). Aggregates of PrPsc lead to spongiform vacuolation. Clinically, this manifests with rapidly progressive mental deterioration with prominent executive dysfunction (declining concentration, judgment, and memory) and startle myoclonus. Further diagnostic investigation may reveal 14-3-3 protein on CSF analysis and synchronous sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG). CJD usually leads to death within 1 year.

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension.

However, as patients age, their risk for malignancy increases significantly. Therefore, stable patients older than 50 years of age with rectal bleeding, regardless of their symptoms or family history, should receive a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. Patients younger than 50 with warning signs of colon cancer (abnormal bowel habits, weight loss, family history of colon cancer, iron deficiency anemia) should also be evaluated with a colonoscopy. Often, colonoscopy is performed routinely at the age of 50 or 10 years prior to the age of presentation for malignancy in family members (whichever is sooner). Of note, even if there is an apparent cause for a lower GI bleed in patients 50 or older (such as hemorrhoids) colonoscopy is still indicated to rule out malignancy.\n\nBarry et al. note the guidelines for colon cancer screening. They note the different age cutoffs. The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50-75 years.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis is incorrect because colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of suspected colon cancer. A CT scan may detect larger masses and a CTA may be performed if there is active bleeding and concern for an arterial source of bleeding that can be intervened upon.\n\nAnswer C: Increasing fiber in the diet may help patients with constipation or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Constipation presents with straining to have bowel movements and hard stools. However, because of this patient's age, he needs a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy.\n\nAnswer D: Observation is not appropriate at this patient's age. Patients greater than 50 years old with bright red blood per rectum should receive a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy despite any recent negative colonoscopy results.\n\nAnswer E: Sigmoidoscopy is less preferred to colonoscopy, as a smaller portion of the colon would be visualized, and colonic polyps or malignancies may be missed.

It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor.

{"question": "A 52-year-old G3P3 woman presents to clinic with a 2-year history of urinary incontinence. She has had frequent, involuntary loss of urine over the last 2 years but presented today because of 10 days of dysuria. She has been treated for 2 urinary tract infections over the past 6 months. She does not endorse any loss of urine with coughing or laughter. She has no chronic medical illnesses and no surgical history. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 15/min. Her BMI is 30 kg/m^2. On pelvic examination, the vagina is dry and atrophic with a 2-cm tender, palpable anterior vaginal mass. The mass does not change with Valsava maneuver. Her postvoid residual volume is 60 mL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Urethral diverticulum", "options": {"A": "Overflow incontinence", "B": "Pelvic organ prolapse", "C": "Stress urinary incontinence", "D": "Urethral diverticulum", "E": "Vesicovaginal fistula"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient is presenting with a history of dysuria, incontinence, and recurrent lower urinary tract infections in conjunction with a tender anterior vaginal wall mass. The most likely diagnosis is a urethral diverticulum.\n\nA urethral diverticulum is an abnormal, localized outpouching of the urethral mucosa often due to recurrent periurethral gland infection. The outpouching can often collect and store urine, resulting in slow postvoid dribbling and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urethral diverticula can often be associated with expressed purulent or bloody discharge on exam. Initial workup includes urinalysis and transvaginal ultrasound. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a pelvic MRI before referral for surgical excision.\n\nGreiman et al. review urethral diverticula and its treatment. They note that surgical repair is challenging. However, it is still recommended to perform surgery in appropriate candidates.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Overflow incontinence (caused by impaired detrusor activity or bladder outlet obstruction) can also present with involuntary loss of urine due to urinary retention. However, this patient\u2019s normal postvoid residual volume (< 150 mL) makes this an unlikely diagnosis. Patients will often present with a constant dribbling of urine and a sensation of incomplete voiding.\n\nAnswer B: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs due to weakened pelvic support and increased intraabdominal pressure and can be exacerbated by increasing parity. While it can also present with incontinence, physical exam often reveals a bulging mass that increases with Valsava maneuver - a finding that is absent in this patient.\n\nAnswer C: Stress urinary incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility leading to urinary leakage from increased intraabdominal pressure. This patient\u2019s urinary loss is unrelated to coughing or laughing, and stress incontinence would not explain the anterior vaginal mass. On exam, urine may be released with coughing.\n\nAnswer E: Vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal tract between the vagina and bladder that presents with constant leakage of urine due to the direct draining of urine from the bladder to the vagina. This patient\u2019s incontinence is intermittent and not constant, and a vesicovaginal fistula would not explain the anterior vaginal mass.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA urethral diverticulum presents with dysuria, intermittent urinary incontinence, and a tender anterior vaginal wall mass that may cause recurrent urinary tract infections.", "realidx": 302, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 52-year-old woman with urinary incontinence and other specific symptoms.

Nasal foreign bodies tend to be unilateral (though bilateral symptoms are plausible) and present with a purulent and bloody discharge.

Visualization of the object should be attempted when possible in order to allow for safe retrieval.\n\nKrulewitz and Fix review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epistaxis. They discuss how foreign body insertion is a major risk factor for the development of epistaxis. They recommend assessment of airway and breathing in the setting of severe epistaxis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A bleeding and infected vessel of the Kiesselbach plexus could suggest a complicated case of epistaxis. The persistent, unilateral symptoms in this patient point toward a different diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for foreign bodies should be suspected in children.\n\nAnswer C: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to occur in young male patients and can be associated with infectious mononucleosis. Epistaxis can be a symptom and the mass can be visualized. This disease tends to present in older patients and is far less common than foreign bodies. Treatment is with surgical resection.\n\nAnswer D: Septal perforation can occur secondary to repeat cocaine use but would not present with unilateral nasal discharge in a pediatric patient.

The most appropriate next step in management is treatment with clozapine.\n\nSchizophrenia presents with auditory and/or visual hallucinations among many other findings. The most appropriate initial treatments are with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) or an atypical antipsychotic (risperidone). Once a patient has failed treatment with multiple medications (at least 2) from different classes, the next best step in management is clozapine. This medication is reserved for patients who have sustained treatment failure (because of the side effects of clozapine). These include weight gain, life-threatening agranulocytosis, and aplastic anemia. Regular complete blood count laboratory testing should be drawn while on clozapine to check for this side effect. Patients who develop this complication should immediately stop the medication but the side effect can be irreversible.\n\nKhokhar et al. review the evidence regarding the use of clozapine to treat schizophrenia. They discuss how side effects of this medication include agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and seizures. They recommend using this medication with care and monitoring for the development of these complications.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic that is likely to fail given that haloperidol did not work for him. Important side effects of this medication include hypotension and sedation due to anticholinergic properties. This medication also has an idiosyncratic complication of corneal deposits.\n\nAnswer C: Fluphenazine is another typical anti-psychotic that is a strong D2 antagonist like haloperidol. If haloperidol failed, it is unlikely that another typical antipsychotic would work with such a similar mechanism of action. This medication has a high association with extrapyramidal side effects such as dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia.\n\nAnswer D: Olanzapine is another atypical antipsychotic. Switching to another atypical antipsychotic is a viable option. Given that this patient has already failed another atypical antipsychotic and that his symptoms remain, the best therapy at this point would be clozapine. Side effects include weight gain and dyslipidemia.\n\nAnswer E: Thioridazine is a low-potency anti-psychotic that would likely not work if more potent drugs such as haloperidol or risperidone have already failed.

Occlusions to branches of the basilar artery lead to infarctions of various parts of the midbrain. Midbrain lesions almost always manifest with an ipsilateral oculomotor palsy (ptosis from the levator palpebrae muscle; mydriasis from loss of parasympathetic inflow; abduction and excyclotorsion of the globe from the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior obliques). There may also be contralateral ataxia (cerebellar peduncle after decussation and red nucleus), contralateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract before decussation at the medulla), and parkinsonian tremor (substantia nigra).\n\nSciacca et al. review the anatomy and clinical signs of strokes of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. They discuss how a stroke of the midbrain will present with oculomotor palsy and paresis. They recommend being vigilant for symptoms of strokes to allow for early diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) is usually due to a stroke of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This presents with ipsilateral ataxia, loss of pain and temperature sensation in the face, dysarthria, and Horner syndrome, as well as contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without dysarthria, lateral medullary syndrome is less likely.\n\nAnswer B: Lateral pontine syndrome can be caused by interruption of blood supply by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It presents with ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral facial hemianesthesia, ipsilateral facial paralysis, nystagmus and vertigo, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without facial paralysis, vertigo, and oculomotor palsy, midbrain stroke is more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer C: Medial pontine syndrome can be due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery and disrupts the abducens nerve, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus, and the corticospinal tract. This results in contralateral spastic hemiparesis, ipsilateral lateral rectus paralysis (eye turned down and in), and contralateral loss of vibration and stereognosis. In this patient with ptosis, and an eye turned down and out, oculomotor palsy and a midbrain stroke are more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. Strokes of the internal capsule would not be expected to lead to oculomotor nerve palsy or dysdiadochokinesia. The constellation of ataxia, hemiparesis, and cranial nerve palsy is more suggestive of a brainstem pathology than of a lacunar stroke in the internal capsule.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMidbrain strokes commonly present with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis/hemiplegia, contralateral hemiataxia, and/or contralateral tremor.", "realidx": 306, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 67-year-old man with specific neurological symptoms and asks which region of the brain is most likely affected.
