Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding.

In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss is the most common underlying cause of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment can often present similarly to behavioral or persistent developmental disorders. In a child with poor language skills, social skills, and self-isolation, hearing loss should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses. Undetected hearing loss can progress with poor academic performance, personal-social maladjustment, and emotional difficulties as children progress through critical development stages. The treatment for hearing loss is the restoration of hearing through hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other supportive measures.\n\nDammeyer et al. studied the impact of childhood hearing loss on family life. They found that children with additional disabilities were more likely to be ignored by parents. They recommend understanding family dynamics in order to better support patients and families.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer B: Autism spectrum screening questionnaire is useful in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children presenting with social isolation and poor communication skills. Autism spectrum disorder often presents with repetitive behaviors and fixed interests, which are absent in this child. Hearing loss should be ruled out first before pursuing this diagnosis. Treatment of autism spectrum disorders is early intervention and counseling.\n\nAnswer C: Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales should be obtained to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations.

Degmacytes (\"bite cells\") will be seen on peripheral blood smears in these patients.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia when exposed to an oxidizing substance such as sulfa drugs or fava beans. Laboratory tests will show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Since hemolysis releases intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase will be increased. Hemoglobin is then metabolized in the spleen into unconjugated bilirubin, which will cause an elevated bilirubin level that is primarily indirect. In the acute setting, G6PD levels will be normal because the most compromised cells have all been hemolyzed. Obtaining a G6PD level in between episodes of hemolysis is therefore required to observe the chronically decreased G6PD in these patients. A peripheral blood smear will reveal degmacytes (\"bite cells\") and Heinz bodies. Avoidance of oxidative stress to red blood cells is the most important component of management in these patients.\n\nBelfield and Tichy discuss the classic presentation of G6PD deficiency in patients. The authors review oxidizing medications such as rasburicase, primaquine, dapsone, pegloticase, and methylene blue. The authors recommend avoiding initiation of these medications whenever possible until a G6PD diagnostic test has been performed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acanthocytes can be seen in patients with liver disease due to defective production of lipoproteins; however, these cells do not undergo acute hemolytic destruction.

Patients with thalassemia will present with chronic anemia without acute episodes of hemolysis. The increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels in this patient indicate an acute hemolytic event.\n\nAnswer D: Schistocytes can be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with TTP present with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury. DIC is a common downstream pathway for many processes such as sepsis, malignancy, and eclampsia; however, it would present with diffuse clotting and bleeding from all sites.\n\nAnswer E: Spherocytes can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which may result in hemolysis during times of acute stress; however, this patient denies symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later.

They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting.

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis.

It presents in the first 8 weeks of life with jaundice, acholic stools, dark urine, hepatomegaly, mild transaminitis, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The definitive diagnosis is made by a cholangiogram that will demonstrate the obliteration of these ducts. Patients who are untreated experience fatal neurological defects due to kernicterus and accumulation of bilirubin in the brain.

They discuss how researchers are trying to reverse the liver fibrosis associated with this disease. They recommend early referral for a Kasai procedure or liver transplant as needed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased metabolism of bilirubin occurs with enzymatic deficiencies such as those seen in Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert syndrome. Both Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert syndromes lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (much more severe in Crigler-Najjar syndrome) rather than the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer B: Increased enterohepatic circulation describes the pathophysiology underlying breast milk jaundice. Breast milk jaundice classically peaks in the first 2 weeks of life and leads to unconjugated rather than conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment is usually supportive and patients can typically continue to breastfeed.\n\nAnswer C: Increased production of bilirubin can occur in hemolytic diseases such as G6PD deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis.

Tourette syndrome can be medically treated with antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol.\n\nTourette syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., grimacing, sniffing) and 1 or more phonic tics (e.g., throat-clearing, barking) that occur for at least 1 year. Tics must begin before the age of 18 years, and their location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity must change over time. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are often co-morbid conditions. Common first-line treatments for Tourette syndrome-related tics include habit reversal training and alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine. However, the only pharmacologic treatments approved for Tourette syndrome in the United States are the antipsychotics haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole. Risperidone is also used due to its favorable side effect profile.\n\nSeideman and Seideman review the current treatments for Tourette syndrome. They note it is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that often occurs in children and presents with motor and phonic tics. They recommend treating with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for optimal care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors but is not approved for treatment of Tourette syndrome.

Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen.

HD typically presents with mood changes and abnormal movements (particularly chorea or myoclonus) over weeks to months. Although executive function can be affected early on, memory is usually preserved until relatively late in the disease. Frontotemporal dementia, in contrast, usually presents with behavioral changes, and Alzheimer disease has memory impairment as an early sign.

The first step in the resuscitation of patients with variceal hemorrhage is rapid administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and octreotide.\n\nEsophageal and gastric varices, most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, are abnormally distended veins that are a product of venous congestion from portal hypertension. As these varices can project into the gastrointestinal lumen, they are subject to rupture either spontaneously or by mechanical disruption (e.g., tearing by food particles). Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis as it can quickly progress to hemorrhagic shock or airway loss (if profuse vomiting is present). Patients should immediately receive 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (or central IV access) with which to administer IV fluid boluses to increase circulating volume. Blood should be transfused as needed, and a massive transfusion protocol may be needed. Patients should also be given octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, in an effort to divert blood away from the hemorrhaging varices. Other treatments that should be given include ceftriaxone (to reduce bacteremia and mortality), proton pump inhibitors, and possibly interventions such as tranexamic acid. Upper GI endoscopy and banding are the definitive therapy.\n\nStanley et al review the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding with initial IV fluid resuscitation as the first measure to achieve hemodynamic stability. They also report that for patients with cirrhosis, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide should be started as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Red blood cell transfusion is indicated at a hemoglobin transfusion of 7.0-8.0 g/dL. Definitive therapy is endoscopy with variceal ligation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon tamponade is often performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit as a temporizing measure to achieve hemostasis for patients with severe and persistent variceal hemorrhage. The balloon is inserted into the esophagus or stomach and inflated to apply direct pressure to the bleeding varices; this buys valuable time in the transition to definitive endoscopic management.\n\nAnswer B: Ceftriaxone is administered to patients with cirrhosis who present with an upper gastrointestinal bleed as a prophylactic measure against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and antibiotics should not delay initial intravenous fluid resuscitation as well as other measures to reduce and/or stop the bleeding. While this patient should receive ceftriaxone, it is more dire to first give fluids, blood, and octreotide.\n\nAnswer C: Nadolol or other nonselective beta-blocker therapy is indicated as secondary prophylaxis to prevent future bleeding episodes for patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage. Non-selective beta blockers such as nadolol decrease portal pressure, but are contraindicated in the acute setting as they could exacerbate hypovolemic shock by reducing cardiac output.\n\nAnswer D: Platelet transfusion is required for patients with variceal hemorrhage with an initial platelet count < 50,000/mm^3, and for those who receive a significant amount of blood products during their resuscitation (significant dilutional thrombocytopenia can occur after 10-12 units of transfused red blood cells). This patient's platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3, and he has not yet received blood products.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of a cirrhosis patient with acute variceal hemorrhage is the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, symptoms, physical exam findings, vital signs, and laboratory results.

This can lead to hyperlipidemia (due to loss of lipoproteins), hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III and protein C/S), and hypoalbuminemia. Most serum calcium is bound to albumin, so when albumin is lost in the urine, it can lead to profound hypocalcemia. The ionized or free portion of calcium remains the same; therefore, these patients do not exhibit symptoms of hypocalcemia. Furthermore, the loss of albumin will reduce the oncotic pressure in the vessels resulting in massive extravasation of fluid and anasarca.\n\nAmbler et al. report a case of a patient who presented with a DVT and was found to have nephrotic syndrome. They discuss how the patient had asymptomatic changes in lab values including calcium. They recommend performing a urine dipstick for protein in cases of suspected nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antithrombin III deficiency is a common cause of a hypercoagulable state because antithrombin III normally helps to neutralize coagulation factors.

Asymptomatic antithrombin III deficiency does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer B: Factor V Leiden is the most common cause of a hypercoagulable state because this mutation renders factor V unable to be inactivated by proteins C and S.

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure.

The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin).

These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemophilia A caused by factor 8 deficiency.\n\nHemophilia is a deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B). Common symptoms of hemophilia include hemarthrosis, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. Laboratory testing is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as hemophilia is characterized by an isolated prolongation of PTT without a change in PT. The factors involved in hemophilia participate only in the indirect cascade of coagulation factor activation. Similarly, since bleeding time depends only upon platelet function and not coagulation factors, hemophilia presents with a normal bleeding time. Treatment of hemophilia includes desmopressin in mild cases and factor replacement in moderate to severe disease.\n\nBerntorp et al. present a review of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. They discuss how these patients now have normal life expectancies with the advent of factor replacement therapy. They recommend being vigilant for the development of anti-factor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-platelet antibodies are responsible for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This disease is caused by autoimmune antibody formation that damages platelets and causes them to be removed by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. It usually occurs in children after an acute viral infection and it presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces with laboratory findings showing an increased bleeding time, decreased platelets, and a normal PT/PTT.\n\nAnswer C: Factor 9 deficiency (hemophilia B) presents nearly identically to hemophilia A with a normal PT, prolonged PTT, and normal bleeding time with a history of bleeding in male relatives. However, because hemophilia B is epidemiologically less common than hemophilia A, hemophilia A is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer D: GP1b deficiency causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by unusually large platelets and a low platelet count. Like von Willebrand disease (vWD), patients often present with cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, abnormal bleeding from minor trauma, and a prolonged bleeding time, which this patient does not have. It can be distinguished from vWD by a ristocetin assay. Treatment can include tranexamic acid.\n\nAnswer E: Von Willebrand factor deficiency results in vWD, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Unlike this patient, patients with vWD also present with a prolonged bleeding time. Patients with vWD will also have an increased PT because this factor is responsible for stabilizing coagulation factor 8.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHemophilia A is caused by factor 8 deficiency and presents with hemarthrosis, frequent bruising, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal bleeding with a prolonged PTT with a normal PT and bleeding time.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines.

The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation.

The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient’s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome).

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms.

A detailed workup is not needed if the clinical story is clear, but an orthostatic test can be completed. One way to do this is to assess the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon. Another way requires the patient to collect urine at multiple times throughout the day. A diagnosis is confirmed if the morning sample is protein-free but the evening sample contains protein.

The most appropriate initial step in management is intubation and plasmapheresis.\n\nMyasthenic crisis is an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis caused by under-dosing myasthenia gravis treatments or precipitated by infection, surgery, and certain medications such as aminoglycosides and beta-blockers. Symptoms include bulbar muscle weakness and type 2 respiratory failure (inadequate alveolar ventilation). The most appropriate initial step in management is to maintain adequate respiratory function by intubation. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is used to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from circulation, and steroids are started for long-term therapy. Avoiding risk factors and pre-medication before procedures with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is important for preventing repeat occurrences.\n\nRodrigues et al. review the evidence regarding the occurrence of myasthenic crisis in patients with COVID. They discuss how treatment with IVIG and plasma exchange were important in the care of these patients. They recommend also considering whether rituximab and tocilizumab may be effective in these cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine can be used in a cholinergic crisis. A cholinergic crisis is an acute exacerbation of muscle weakness due to over-medication with cholinergic anti-cholinesterases. This disease would present with diarrhea, sweating, miosis, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. It rarely occurs with proper dosing of pyridostigmine.\n\nAnswer B: Edrophonium can be used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor. In a positive test, a patient will exhibit temporary resolution of muscle weakness. In this patient’s case, the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis has already been made and he also had a recent exposure to a pharmaceutical known to precipitate myasthenic crisis.\n\nAnswer C: Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of myasthenia gravis, but it is contraindicated in the initial treatment of myasthenic crisis. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may increase respiratory secretions, which can worsen respiratory failure.\n\nAnswer E: Thymectomy is indicated in refractory cases of myasthenia gravis (and for increased risk of thymoma).

Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient’s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and diagnostic test results (e.g., Dix-Hallpike maneuver, head impulse test, and skew deviation).

Risk factors for AAA include advanced age (> 60 years), smoking history, male sex, and history of atherosclerosis. AAA can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic until it markedly expands or ruptures, leading to abdominal pain, back pain, or flank pain. The evaluation of suspected AAA depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the existence of an AAA. A hemodynamically unstable patient with a known history of AAA should be assumed to have a ruptured AAA and undergo surgical intervention without further workup (though bedside ultrasound can support the diagnosis). In an unstable patient without a known history, a bedside ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis should precede surgical intervention. In a hemodynamically stable patient with or without a known AAA history, an abdominal CTA is appropriate.\n\nSakalihasan et al. present a review of the presentation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. They discuss how patients are often asymptomatic until catastrophic rupture occurs.

Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection.

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent.

In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water.

This is concerning for vertebrobasilar syndrome, caused by blood vessel narrowing.\n\nVertebrobasilar syndrome is caused by narrowing (via causes such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or congenital narrowing among others) of the vertebrobasilar vascular system. It is a common cause of syncope that may be worsened by changes in head position or standing rapidly. Other unique features include numbness/tingling, a sensation of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Note the episodes of syncope in this condition are intermittent and specifically provoked and do not have lasting/permanent neurological deficits in contrast to a stroke. Management is first centered on vascular imaging which may include a CTA head/neck or an MRA head/neck. Further care depends on the symptoms present but typically involves smoking cessation, glycemic control, blood pressure control, aspirin, and a statin.\n\nXuan-Ting et al. review posterior circulation strokes which occur more frequently in patients with atherosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar system. They note that MRI is one of the most accurate tests for assessing posterior circulation strokes which may present with dizziness and syncope. It is far superior to CT imaging. For this reason, they recommend that CT imaging alone cannot definitively rule out a posterior circulation stroke.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia can cause sudden onset and offset syncope without prodromal symptoms.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration).

Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient’s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures.

These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient’s underwear and irritation of the skin.

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD’Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression.

Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child’s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes.

If the healthcare worker’s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient’s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient’s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects.

In patients without significant trauma, the presence of signs of spinal cord compression (e.g., urinary retention, bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia, focal neurologic deficits), history of or strong risk factors for cancer, signs of infection, or risk of vertebral compression fracture should prompt additional work-up with imaging such as radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging.

Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic results.

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers.

Although pyloric stenosis classically presents with an “olive-shaped” mass in the epigastrium, the mass cannot be palpated in some patients. Any infant who develops new, persistent vomiting in the first 2 months of life and has associated dehydration or failure to thrive should undergo an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for pyloric stenosis. Patients should undergo resuscitation prior to the definitive treatment, which is a pyloromyotomy.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction. They discuss how malrotation, jejunoileal atresia, duodenal atresia, and colonic atresia are common causes of this finding. They recommend surgical management of these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is not helpful in evaluating for pyloric stenosis. It is more useful in the workup of bilious vomiting, as several etiologies of bilious vomiting (such as duodenal atresia and Hirschsprung disease) can be seen on an abdominal radiograph. Treatment of these conditions is surgical excision of the defective segment of colon.\n\nAnswer C: Supplementing breastfeeding with formula would not be appropriate for this patient as his failure to thrive is driven by gastric outlet obstruction.

Thus, he should be reassured and maintained on the current dose of his SSRI, with follow-up after the 4 week mark to see if his symptoms have improved.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is managed initially with cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. The typical first-line medication is an SSRI. SSRIs may take at least 4 weeks or more to begin working, so patients that return before this time period should be reassured and encouraged to let the medication take effect as long as they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts or intent. If the medication is not working after at least 4 weeks, the next steps in management could include increasing the dose of the current medication, changing SSRIs, adding another antidepressant agent, or adding a low dose of levothyroxine.

They note different options including CBT and pharmacotherapy. They recommend appropriate treatment with a first-line agent based on the patient and their circumstances.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering levothyroxine is appropriate as an augmenting agent in patients who do not have an improvement in symptoms on SSRIs or other antidepressants even if their TSH is within the normal range. However, it would not be attempted at this point given this patient has not given his current medication sufficient time to begin working. There is limited evidence to support its use overall.

His elevated troponin is likely secondary to poor renal clearance and dehydration, which is most appropriately addressed with IV fluids such as Ringer lactate.\n\nTroponin is a lab marker classically thought to be elevated when there is an injury to the heart causing leakage of this enzyme from the cardiac myocyte. However, there are many possible causes of an elevated troponin that may not be directly cardiac in nature or related to myocardial ischemia. Acute kidney injury is a common cause of an elevated troponin. For this reason, patients with an elevated troponin with kidney dysfunction without any cardiac symptoms or ECG changes should have their renal etiology addressed, and this will often clear the troponin. In the setting of a prerenal injury (dehydration causing poor kidney perfusion and a BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1), IV fluids will restore perfusion and treat the underlying cause. Patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure should have an ECG obtained and their current troponin should be compared to previous troponin levels to ensure it is not higher than their baseline. If there is uncertainty regarding a troponin level, it can be trended to see if it is rising, falling, or staying the same. Correlation with clinical symptoms is important when evaluating an elevated troponin level.\n\nMasri et al. review the causes of an elevated troponin. They note that a troponin elevation can be seen in myopericarditis, renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, rhabdomyolysis, stroke, and many other possible causes that are not related to myocardial infarction. They recommend keeping a broad differential and correlating the troponin with the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin would be appropriate management of an elevated troponin secondary to acute coronary syndrome as its antiplatelet activity reduces mortality.

This patient has no cardiac symptoms and has a better alternative explanation for their troponin elevation.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol and aspirin may be indicated in acute coronary syndrome, and metoprolol would reduce this patient's heart rate. However, note that this patient's tachycardia is secondary to volume depletion; thus, beta-blockade for sinus tachycardia is inappropriate and may make the patient hemodynamically unstable.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a urinalysis and creatine phosphokinase level may be performed in rhabdomyolysis which presents in the setting of seizures, electrical shock, heatstroke, or with vigorous exertion. Patients will complain of muscle pain, oliguria, and dark urine. Management is centered on the administration of large volumes of fluid to protect the kidney and clear the toxic myoglobin. Note that rhabdomyolysis may elevate the troponin; however, there is nothing in this patient's history that suggests rhabdomyolysis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPrerenal injury causing an acute kidney injury may elevate the troponin due to decreased renal clearance and should be addressed with the administration of fluids.", "cleanse_cot": "The problem provides a detailed clinical scenario, including the patient's history, symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results.

The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer.

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole.

They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber.

While it can also present with incontinence, physical exam often reveals a bulging mass that increases with Valsava maneuver - a finding that is absent in this patient.\n\nAnswer C: Stress urinary incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility leading to urinary leakage from increased intraabdominal pressure. This patient’s urinary loss is unrelated to coughing or laughing, and stress incontinence would not explain the anterior vaginal mass. On exam, urine may be released with coughing.\n\nAnswer E: Vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal tract between the vagina and bladder that presents with constant leakage of urine due to the direct draining of urine from the bladder to the vagina. This patient’s incontinence is intermittent and not constant, and a vesicovaginal fistula would not explain the anterior vaginal mass.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA urethral diverticulum presents with dysuria, intermittent urinary incontinence, and a tender anterior vaginal wall mass that may cause recurrent urinary tract infections.", "cleanse_cot": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem provides a detailed clinical vignette, including the patient's history, physical examination findings, and relevant diagnostic information. It describes the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings (e.g., dry and atrophic vagina, tender anterior vaginal mass), and objective data (e.g., postvoid residual volume). The question does not refer to or imply the need for any missing original content, such as graphs, figures, charts, tables, or images. All necessary information to solve the problem is present in the text and options provided.\n\n### Classification Response:\nText Only", "predicted_answer_base_direct": "B"}
